Their team had not played well lately, and yet, all of one win stood between them and the franchise&#x2019;s first postseason berth in more than two decades.</p><p>Suddenly, their catcher, Cal Raleigh, walked in. The manager, Scott Servais, needed to deliver some less-than-ideal news.</p><p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not playing tomorrow,&#x201D; Servais said.</p><p>Raleigh balked. On the night the Mariners might end the longest playoff drought in professional sports, they wanted him to sit? &#x201C;You gotta let me finish this off,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when assistant general manager Justin Hollander jumped in. &#x201C;Let me mediate here,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Maybe you can come in as the game goes and finish it.&#x201D;</p><p>Raleigh didn&#x2019;t love the compromise, but he didn&#x2019;t argue, either. He showed up at T-Mobile Park and went through his routine. He watched the Mariners take a 1&#x2013;0 lead in the bottom of the first, watched the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/oakland-athletics">A&#x2019;s</a></span>&#xA0;tie the game in the top of the second and watched both teams play to a standstill until the bottom of the ninth. Hollander, watching from a suite above the field, wished that Servais had gone to Raleigh in the seventh. But Servais didn&#x2019;t do that.</p><p>He turned to Raleigh in the ninth.</p><p>Hollander remained in the suite, high above the field. He stood next to Jerry Dipoto, his mentor, the GM and lead architect of a remarkable resurgence. Both looked down at the field, at Raleigh, at the moment that could change everything, upending two decades of tortured history, sending the Mariners to the postseason for the first time since 2001.</p><p>Hollander said to Dipoto, &#x201C;This is about as &#x2018;Mariners&#x2019; as it gets.&#x201D; Meaning fingernail-biting, tension-heightening, never-easy, especially not now.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m betting on Cal for the win,&#x201D; Dipoto said.</p><p>Down below, in front of 44,754 fans who were open to trading souls for one run of any sort, Raleigh let two balls pass. He swung and missed at a slider. He took another ball. A&#x2019;s reliever Domingo Acevedo threw him two more sliders, and Raleigh missed one and fouled the other off. Then Acevedo went to the old slider well one too many times. The last pitch he threw hung low over the plate. Raleigh &#x201C;went down and got it,&#x201D; Hollander says, while watching the replay hours later inside the same office where they met with Raleigh the night before.</p><p>Raleigh launched the pitch toward the right-field stands. He leaned his body left, trying to ascertain the trajectory, trying to will it fair. The Mariners spilled out of their dugout, toward the infield. At that point, everyone knew. &#x201C;Holy s---,.&#x201D; Hollander says. &#x201C;It hit the window [on the second level of the stands].&#x201D;</p><p>The ball was fair and gone and, more importantly, <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/10/01/seattle-mariners-break-21-year-playoff-drought-clinch-wild-card-spot">the drought was over</a>, right that very second, after something like a million seconds had passed by. Hollander says he leapt into Dipoto&#x2019;s arm &#x201C;like a 7-year-old.&#x201D; Dipoto confirms this, adding, &#x201C;He might have wrapped his legs around my waist.&#x201D;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Raleigh circled the bases as Seattle fans who waited two decades for this moment rose to their feet and roared. Fireworks exploded overhead. The bullpen pitchers sprinted toward the dog-pile of Mariners near the pitcher&#x2019;s mound. The players joined in a circle, did the can-can dance, then piled atop each other, and it seemed fair to wonder, at that moment, whether a ballpark could spontaneously combust.</p><p>Raleigh found Hollander on the infield. &#x201C;Hey, thanks for getting me worked into the lineup tonight,&#x201D; he quipped.</p><p>That postseason drought, the thing that vexed and puzzled and embarrassed Seattle&#x2019;s baseball team, ended Friday night. It ended with a blast and a boom, relief and exaltation, and more than a few tears falling down so many cheeks. It ended because of a faux-hawked hero, an architect who wore his &#x201C;B&#x201D;-level shoes in anticipation and an audacious plan put into place five years ago that&#x2019;s not even close to a culmination.</p><p>Yes, the Mariners, the low-luck, high-loss franchise that spent the past two decades burning through managers, general managers and superstars, secured a wild card bid on Friday night. That might not seem like a lot. But here, after everything, it was.</p><hr><figure>

    </figure><p>In these parts, the drought became more than a drought, more than two decades of <em>watching</em> playoff baseball, more than a few thousand jokes lobbed at the franchise that best understood futility. The Mariners breathed life into the drought, making their inglorious streak into a character, one that was old enough to vote and mere weeks from being old enough to drink.</p><p>The Mariners last played a postseason baseball game in 2001, which feels like another lifetime, which is because, well, it is. Back in that long-ago October, the news was all hurricanes (Iris), Taliban (U.S. warplanes staging their first major assault in Kabul), presidential mishaps (the Supreme Court barred Bill Clinton), coverage of immigration detention centers, higher-than-usual interest in the Federal Reserve (they cut rates) and the-world-is-falling-apart scares (like anthrax). Time is indeed a flat circle. The Mariners&#x2019; drought was proof.</p><p>Another lifetime? The Mariners can sympathize. They tied the Major League Baseball record in 2001 with 116 regular-season wins. They figured they&#x2019;d be back. They&#x2019;d make another run. Certainly, nobody believed they wouldn&#x2019;t return to the postseason until 2022!</p><p>Adding to the angst was how and with whom they kept the drought alive. Seattle lost more games than it won (at a .480 clip) from 2002 to &#x2019;21. But they were stretches of something resembling elite baseball. There was an MVP (Ichiro) and a Cy Young winner (F&#xE9;lix Hern&#xE1;ndez) smack in their primes. There were big-value trades (Robinson Can&#xF3;), franchise stalwarts (Kyle Seager) and many stars (Edwin D&#xED;az, Nelson Cruz, Adri&#xE1;n Beltr&#xE9;). But there wasn&#x2019;t a single postseason appearance.</p><p>The franchise won 93 games in 2002 and 93 games in &#x2018;03. But what felt like a small dip from an aging roster before a rebuild and another run was actually the apex of the last 20 seasons before this one. In &#x2018;16, three games out felt like a triumph. Last season, <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2021/09/21/are-the-mariners-for-real">one game out felt like the start of something new</a>.</p><p>Regardless, in 2001, <em>Shrek</em> debuted at the box office and Blockbuster still held the movie world in a headlock. But as both faded, the Mariners persisted. The best thing that could be said was this: at least they were consistent.</p><p>And yet&#x2014;AND YET&#x2014;on the 7,649th day since their last playoff game, after every other MLB team, every NFL team, every NHL team and every NBA team last made a postseason appearance, after the Patriots won six championships and Tom Brady won seven, after the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/chicago-cubs">Cubs</a></span>&#xA0;won the freaking World Series and so did two kinds of Sox (White, Red), the Mariners strangled the drought until it died. To call that merciful doesn&#x2019;t do it justice. Merciful would have been 10 years. Or 15.</p><p>Those poor Mariners fans. Their team wouldn&#x2019;t exist if not for a lawsuit, if the city and state hadn&#x2019;t sued the American League when, in 1969, Seattle&#x2019;s first team, the Pilots, bolted for Milwaukee after just one season. Eight years later, the Mariners were born, and even that didn&#x2019;t go very smoothly. Their new logo&#x2014;a trident pointed toward the dirt&#x2014;was also a sign from Greek mythology. What did it mean? Bad luck! Related or not, Seattle&#x2019;s first winning season came in &#x2019;91.</p><p>And then, after everything, after the departure of so many stars, after pigs flew and hell froze over, 21 seasons winnowed down to one glorious night. Friday night. The Mariners were already selling playoff tickets. They could see The End and a beginning.</p><hr><figure>

    </figure><p>As he whittled away the final hours before the first pitch, Servais took a walk around the stadium. He stopped in the upper deck, above Edgar&#x2019;s Cantina, named for the Mariners legendary designated hitter and current hitting consultant, Edgar Mart&#xED;nez. He&#x2019;s not sure why, as he tells this story in his office in a quiet moment deep into a night of celebration, but his eyes landed on the team&#x2019;s postseason banners. <em>It&#x2019;s disgusting that the last one is from &#x2019;01</em>, he thought to himself. <em>Today&#x2019;s the day it ends</em>.</p><p>Around the same time, Dipoto was heading to the ballpark. Having lived through a few champagne celebrations earlier in his career, he wore a pair of Auburn-brand shoes, because he knew that he could wash them. He also spied something significant: a bottle of 2001 Spring Mountain red wine. The year was too perfect, so he grabbed the bottle and an opener and hoped he needed both that night.</p><p>The die-hards, the bandwagon types, the families and the curious all arrived hours before first pitch. They packed the bars on Occidental Avenue and sold out every store in sight. They knew that history might happen, and they wanted to remember every detail; wanted to preserve the memory; and wanted, more than anything, for the Mariners to win.</p><p>Most knew at least the basics of the previous 12 months: the mid-November <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2021/11/27/adam-frazier-trade-mariners-padres-all-star-infielder">trade for Adam Frazier</a> &#x2026; the splashy late November <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2021/11/30/mariners-sign-robbie-ray-keep-pace-american-league-west-astros-rangers">signing of reigning AL Cy Young winner Robbie Ray</a> &#x2026; the March deal that <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/03/14/jesse-winker-eugenio-suarez-trade-mariners-reds">netted Jesse Winker and Eugenio Su&#xE1;rez</a> &#x2026; the June <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/06/28/mariners-royals-carlos-santana-trade-the-opener">swap for Carlos Santana</a> &#x2026; the here-we-go July <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/07/30/seattle-mariners-trade-pitcher-luis-castillo-playoff-drought">trade for starter Luis Castillo</a>, and the <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/23/julio-rodriguez-daily-cover">emergence of a young star as bright as any in baseball in Julio Rodr&#xED;guez</a>.</p><p>Dipoto, while retrieving the bottle of wine from his office hours later, says hours later that he was certain way back in spring training that the Mariners would end their drought this year. He knew the day the Mariners cemented the trade for Winker and Su&#xE1;rez.</p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/23/julio-rodriguez-daily-cover">As SI reported last week</a>, Rodr&#xED;guez would have made the postseason roster had the Mariners advanced last year. Instead, another season ended the way the previous 19 had ended, on the final day before the playoffs. Still, they entered spring training certain that they had upgraded, both with rookies (Rodr&#xED;guez and George Kirby) and with veterans (Su&#xE1;rez, Winker, Frazier and Santana all made All Star teams in previous seasons). Combine that with a stingy bullpen, strong defense, years of good drafts and high-level development&#x2014;and this grand Mariners rebuild that started in late 2018 with the trading of Robinson Can&#xF3;&#x2019;s albatross of a contract to the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/new-york-mets">Mets</a></span>, seemed poised to at least take another step.</p><p>But it&#x2019;s never that easy, is it? Not with Seattle&#x2019;s baseball team. Not when two decades of bottled emotion, of players and managers and everyone else insisting that the drought didn&#x2019;t matter, that it didn&#x2019;t weigh on them, was unleashed late Friday. Then, it was obvious, from the reporters who wore ponchos into the clubhouse to the players who donned goggles to shield their eyes to the cigar smoke that wafted in the air. There were drinks stations set up; a clear tarp, laid down. Bottles of team-issued vino&#x2014;<em>clinched</em>, the bottle read&#x2014;were shaken and poured over so many heads. The remnants began pooling on the floor, turning the clubhouse into Lake Corona, from the beers that players clutched.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not done,&#x201D; Servais said, while also acknowledging that &#x201C;nothing will ever top this for me. Nothing is more gratifying.&#x201D; He started to say something else but several players dumped alcoholic beverages on him. </p><p>Dipoto stood on the edges, clutching a bottle of vino, his arms perpetually opened, his hair gloriously wet, his smile all but etched onto his face. &#x201C;We came all this way together,&#x201D; he mused. &#x201C;From the ground up to here.&#x201D;</p><p>Per tradition, he gathered in the back of the clubhouse with several coaches and executives. All held miniature gold trophies&#x2014;maybe two inches high&#x2014;and someone grabbed a bottle of Fireball whiskey and filled them to the brim.</p><p>&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s f---ing party,&#x201D; Servais boomed. But first, he grabbed Dipoto, his longtime friend, and Manny Acta, his bench coach. This trio had all been in Seattle together since 2016, with Dipoto arriving a year earlier. They had lived through everything, all the criticism, the playoff-less seasons, all of it. </p><p>&#x201C;We made it,&#x201D; Servais told them. &#x201C;We survived.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;We worked every f---ing step,&#x201D; Dipoto said. </p><hr><figure>

    </figure><p>Even this season, this month, this week. Mariners baseball is never easy, not even when history is made.</p><p>Seattle would not make the playoffs. In June, when they fell 10 games under .500, that was certain.</p><p>The M&#x2019;s would certainly make the playoffs. In July, when the All Star break interrupted a 14-game winning streak, that was certain.</p><p>Seattle baseball fans should have learned something a long time ago, though. With the Mariners and the playoffs, <em>nothing</em> is certain. That record-winning, 116-victory squad? Lost in the ALCS. The 1995 legends? Also lost in the ALCS. The M&#x2019;s, in fact, have only played postseason baseball in four of their 46 seasons. They have competed in seven postseason series (winning only three).</p><p>So please, forgive the locals as September days flew off the calendar and the echoes of seasons&#x2019; past grew louder and louder with each twist. The Mariners were losing again, having dropped 11 of 18 before Wednesday&#x2019;s contest; their <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/23/mariners-place-julio-rodriguez-injured-list-lower-back-tightness-sources">star center fielder landed back on the injured list</a> and even though the oddsmakers still like their drought-terminating chances, something just felt &#x2026; off. Maybe it was the energy with Rodr&#xED;guez sidelined. Or missing Su&#xE1;rez&#x2019;s bat, when an injury kept him out as well. Maybe the Mariners had truly overachieved this season, and this slide marked nothing more than a regression to the mean. Maybe it was ghosts. That upside-down trident. Life.</p><p>That&#x2019;s the thing about these Mariners, though. They&#x2019;re not <em>those Mariners</em>, the teams that failed an ace in Hern&#xE1;ndez, watched Can&#xF3; age rapidly, or played above their ceiling simply to reach a similar position. This group is loose. Relaxed. Unbothered. Nowhere near its ceiling. Nobody, Ty France says, &#x201C;makes more of us than us.&#x201D; So, yes, the line of drought inquiries grew tiresome. But the drought itself didn&#x2019;t faze them; talking about it presented little more than annoyance.</p><p>Internally, where it mattered, the M&#x2019;s oozed confidence. <em>Now is the time</em>, they told each other. <em>End the drought</em>, they said. In recent weeks, they started to say those things in public. But they had already been saying them for weeks.</p><p>Flash forward. Wednesday night. The Mariners were home but scuttling, having been shut out by the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/texas-rangers">Rangers</a></span>&#xA0;the night before. Servais told his players to come late to the ballpark anyway. He wanted to shake them from a routine that wasn&#x2019;t working anymore. He knew Su&#xE1;rez was returning after 10 days on the injured list. Plus, it couldn&#x2019;t get much worse.</p><p>This strategy did more than work. It changed the tenor of how the Mariners played baseball. Everyone involved insists that the mood in the clubhouse never turned, that the vibe never weakened, that the loosest team in MLB remained that way while another promising season teetered on the edge of the worst possible collapse.</p><p>The Mariners won that Wednesday, denting the notion that batting practice matters. The&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/baltimore-orioles">Orioles</a></span>, their chief competition for a wild card slot, lost, and that dwindled Seattle&#x2019;s magic number to three games with eight to play.</p><p>Doubt lingered, given the team and the circumstances. Look at the numbers. They&#x2019;re in! For sure! This is the Mariners. They&#x2019;ll collapse! For sure!</p><p>More proof: of this team, its mettle and its make-up arrived on Thursday, in a game that was taut, wild and extra&#x2014;both in innings and significance. The Mariners trailed, 9&#x2013;8, in the bottom of the 11th. Dylan Moore slapped a single, which moved the automatic runner, Jarred Kelenic, to third. Servais tabbed Luis Torrens to pinch hit, and he sailed a single to right field, scoring Kelenic, as Moore moved to second.</p><p>Next up: J.P. Crawford, a Mariners staple for all but one season of the latest, truest rebuild, who arrived from Philadelphia in 2019. He tried to bunt Moore to third and failed. He tried again. Also failed. But Moore didn&#x2019;t need a bunt! He stole third, and, when Crawford soon sent a stinging line drive down the third-base line that ricocheted off an infielder&#x2019;s glove, Moore scored. <em>Oh, baseball gods</em>, Crawford thought to himself. <em>Finally. Thank you.</em></p><p>Remember: Rodr&#xED;guez was on the injured list. Su&#xE1;rez had just returned. But Kelenic smashed two home runs. Mitch Haniger, a centerpiece of this rebuild, matched him. Marco Gonzales, the staff ace not too long ago, gave Seattle five solid innings. This was <em>exactly</em> what Dipoto had envisioned. Not for the end point. Not to slay the drought. But for how they&#x2019;ll get where they really want to go, whether next year, the year after that, or <em>this one</em>.</p><p>Servais couldn&#x2019;t help but think back to all the drought questions lobbed his way, week after week, for the past seven years. Did he know the Mariners held the longest postseason absence streak in professional sports? Haha! He woke up every morning with that understanding. He thought about the history on his drive into the ballpark. &#x201C;We will end the drought tomorrow,&#x201D; he promised.</p><p>&#x201C;But,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;the goal is winning the World Series.&#x201D;</p><p>First thing&#x2019;s first. The Orioles also lost on Thursday. The Mariners magic number was down to one. One Seattle win. One Baltimore loss. It couldn&#x2019;t be. It had to be.</p><p>Servais sighs late Friday night. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s so hard to win,&#x201D; he says to family and friends inside his office. He says this <em>after</em> he won. Perhaps he will be heartened, though, by another relevant development.</p><p>When SI asked Rodr&#xED;guez if he would return to the lineup Monday night, when he is eligible to come off the IL, he didn&#x2019;t run away, and he didn&#x2019;t duck the question. &#x201C;Probably,&#x201D; he said.</p><hr><figure>

    </figure><p>Inside Servais&#x2019;s office, command central, nearly two hours after the drought officially ended, Dipoto broke the cork on his celebratory bottle of champagne. He found a way to open it&#x2014;metaphor, anyone?&#x2014;then poured that &#x2019;01 Spring Mountain into plastic cups. (Amateur review: smooth and wasted on a sports writer.)</p><p>These men who stand at the center of the Mariners&#x2019; transformation had basically grown up in the minor leagues together, while trying to become managers and executives and scouts. They&#x2019;d often done exactly this at the kitchen table late at night in their two-bedroom apartment. Down a bottle and discuss the day&#x2019;s events. They certainly never pictured this.</p><p>It&#x2019;s no different now. It&#x2019;s totally different now. Now, their families are inside the office, and the 90s hip hop hits blaring from the clubhouse speakers are sadly considered &#x201C;old school.&#x201D; They cannot believe how many fans stayed&#x2014;and for how long. They cannot believe the sounds they heard, sounds long forgotten in this ballpark&#x2014;the roar of a packed house, the simmering tension of a close game with high stakes, the crack of Raleigh&#x2019;s bat, the fireworks exploding.</p><p>One fan had approached the GM during the on-field celebration. &#x201C;Mr. Dipoto, thank you,&#x201D; he gushed. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve waited for this my whole entire life. Thank you. Thanks again.&#x201D; The GM had found his own family, and he wrapped them tight, crying so forcefully that the vein in his forehead protuded. </p><p>For years, these old friends had dismissed the drought, which was understandable, even necessary. But in these moments, on this night, their actions all but screamed how heavy it was to carry and how much it meant the night it lifted, because of Raleigh and Rodr&#xED;guez, Su&#xE1;rez and Haniger and the rest. It was for the woman in the elevator who told Dipoto she was angry with him after he traded Can&#xF3; before the 2019 season. For the fans who never left. For the fans who returned. For a city that was once a baseball town and may, soon, be again. </p><p>The goal remained unchanged: World Series title or bust. But on this night, when two decades of angst, two decades of bad decisions and bad bounces and bad play, finally ended, the celebration needed to commence. This wasn&#x2019;t a small thing. Not by a long shot. But as the revelry continued in Servais&#x2019;s office, Dipoto turned to the small crowd of friends and family with a reminder that the work is never done when the pinnacle is now closer to within reach.</p><p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe we have a day game tomorrow,&#x201D; he said, as he raised his glass of that &#x2019;01 Spring Mountain to his lips. Victory had never tasted that exquisite. And maybe that&#x2019;s because nothing makes a general manager more thirsty than a drought.</p><p><strong>More MLB coverage:<br></strong><strong>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/23/julio-rodriguez-daily-cover">Julio Rodr&#xED;guez Is Here to Save the Mariners</a><br>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/30/austin-riley-daily-cover">How Austin Riley Became the Cornerstone of the Braves&#x2019; Core</a><br>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/22/minor-league-baseball-union-daily-cover">Inside the Drive: The Minor Leaguers Who Sprung a Union on MLB</a><br></strong><strong>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/16/new-mets-daily-cover">How the New Mets are (Mostly) Overcoming Decades of Dysfunction</a><br></strong><strong>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/13/aaron-judge-daily-cover">Everything in Aaron Judge&#x2019;s Career Led Him to This Historic Season</a></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzE5MDU2MzYzNTk0OTUy/mariners-playoffs-october-rise.jpg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzE0NDEzMjM1NTEyMzQ5/cal-raleigh-walkoff-mariners-playoffs.jpg" height="413" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzE5MzU4ODkwMzUzNjkz/mariners-fans-we-did-it.jpg" height="413" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzE5NDg1ODYwMzI0Mzgx/mariners-celebrate-playoffs.jpg" height="413" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzE0NDYyMzU5MjAwOTY4/mariners-drought-ended-jrod.jpg" height="440" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzE5NDA5MDg3NzgzOTY1/scott-servais-mariners-playoffs.jpg" height="413" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mariners Break 21-Year Playoff Drought on Walk-Off Homer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Seattle punched its ticket back to the postseason in dramatic fashion.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/10/01/seattle-mariners-break-21-year-playoff-drought-clinch-wild-card-spot</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/10/01/seattle-mariners-break-21-year-playoff-drought-clinch-wild-card-spot</guid><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><category><![CDATA[MLB]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Daniel Chavkin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 04:43:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzEzNzEyMDgyMTAxNDQ4/cal-raleigh.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Seattle punched its ticket back to the postseason in dramatic fashion.</p><p>For the first time since 2001, the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/seattle-mariners">Mariners</a></span>&#xA0;are headed to the playoffs.

            </p><p>After missing over a year of NBA action, Kawhi Leonard and John Wall are set to return to the floor on Monday night in the Clippers&#x2019; preseason game against the Blazers, coach Tyronn Lue announced Friday.</p><p>Lue shared the news of the anticipated returns ahead of L.A.&#x2019;s preseason opener against&#xA0;Israeli club Maccabi Ra&#x2019;anana at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle. Leonard and Wall were listed among the inactive players for the game but are expected to play next week; Paul George, Nicolas Batum, Norman Powell and Reggie Jackson are also expected to play after sitting out Friday night.</p><p>Friday&#x2019;s news signals a near return to full strength for a Clippers team that has sorely missed Leonard&#x2019;s presence. The two-time NBA champion missed&#xA0;the entire 2021&#x2013;22 regular season after undergoing surgery to repair a&#xA0;partially torn ACL he sustained during the 2021 playoffs.</p><p>Leonard notched a crucial step on his long road to recovery last week ahead of the start of training camp earlier this week. Clippers president Lawrence Frank <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/22/clippers-update-kawhi-leonard-injury-status-before-training-camp">told reporters</a> the five-time All-Star felt great and had been cleared to participate in five-on-five scrimmages.</p><p>With Leonard sidelined, L.A. struggled to find success last season, ultimately missing the playoffs after finishing the year 42&#x2013;40. The team also played 31 games without George as the seven-time All-Star dealt with an elbow injury.</p><p>Barring any setbacks, Leonard figures to step right back into his role as the Batman to George&#x2019;s Robin as the dynamic duo looks to fulfill their quest to take the Clippers to the promised land.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wall, a five-time All-Star during his nine seasons with the Wizards, will take the floor for his first action as a Clipper in his first game since April 2021.

Wall <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/07/01/john-wall-clippers-official-klutch-sports">joined L.A. in July</a> after getting bought out of his deal with Houston; the 32-year-old sat all of last season after reaching a mutual decision with the team to not play.</p><p>While Wall has all the tools to become an ideal fit beside Leonard and George, it remains to be seen how the former No. 1 pick will hold up after years of health issues.</p><p>Wall played 41 games in 2017&#x2013;18 due to nagging knee injuries, and 32 games the following season due to a season-ending left heel injury.

Furthermore, Harbaugh could not fathom Tagovailoa&#x2019;s reaction from Miami&#x2019;s game against the Bills on Sunday, one in which the Dolphins signal caller left the game before returning after he cleared the NFL&#x2019;s concussion protocol. </p><p>&#x201C;It was just something that was astonishing to see,&#x201D; Harbaugh <a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertBreer/status/1575961724393377792?s=20&t=LXp_N7Yef7n1AkoT_wHRoQ">told reporters</a> on Friday. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been coaching [college and NFL] for almost 40 years, and I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like it before. &#x2026; I really couldn&#x2019;t believe it was something that I was seeing.&#x201C;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertBreer/status/1575961724393377792"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><strong>Orr: <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/nfl-tua-tagovailoa-injury-complicated-unsettling">Tua Tagovailoa&#x2019;s Injury Makes It Complicated to Love the NFL</a></strong></p><p>As Tagovailoa was <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/tua-tagovailoa-stretchered-off-after-terrifying-hit-dolphins">stretchered off the field</a> with head and neck injuries during Miami&#x2019;s 27&#x2013;15 loss to the Bengals, Harbaugh believes there comes a time where coaches must make the difficult decision to tell players &#x201C;no&#x201D; they can&#x2019;t play after a vicious hit or anything that puts a player&#x2019;s health in harm&#x2019;s way. &#x201C;Sometimes, you just have to tell them, &#x2019;No.&#x2019; &#x2026; No has to be the answer,&#x201D; he added.</p><p>Harbaugh referenced the concussion of Ravens wide receiver Devin Duvernay, who scored three touchdowns in the first two games of the season, suffered after being hit in the helmet after a 16-yard completion in the fourth quarter of Baltimore&#x2019;s 42&#x2013;38 loss to the Dolphins in Week 2. While Duvernay did not have many symptoms, he was &#x201C;out&#x201D; from the game and most of the week until Sept. 23 when he was cleared leading up to Ravens&#x2019; game on the road against the Patriots on Sunday.</p><p>&#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s the approach you take,&#x201D; Harbaugh <a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertBreer/status/1575961724393377792?s=20&t=LXp_N7Yef7n1AkoT_wHRoQ">said</a>. &#x201C;Then sometimes, guys might be there physically where they&#x2019;re sound, but they are not confident yet.

The deal came nearly a year after rumors of Lillard&#x2019;s interest in playing elsewhere emerged following a first-round playoff loss to a depleted Nuggets team, only for him to (once again) slam the door shut and end talks of a possible exit.</p><p>Ahead of his 11th NBA season,&#xA0;the 32-year-old Lillard<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/damian-lillard-set-to-pass-clyde-drexler-for-trail-blazers-franchise-scoring-record-this-feat-would-mean-a-lot-to-me-161736225.html" rel="nofollow">&#xA0;with Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports</a>&#xA0;about one of the key reasons behind why he&#x2019;s stayed in Portland: the opportunity to pass Hall of Fame guard and Blazers great Clyde Drexler as the franchise&#x2019;s all-time leading scorer.</p><p>&#x201C;This feat would mean a lot to me,&#x201D; Lillard told Haynes. &#x201C;Just the respect I have for the organization and for Clyde and how great of a player he was. I think it shows just how productive I&#x2019;ve been throughout my career. It would truly be an honor.&#x201D;</p><p>Lillard, who has scored 17,510 points in his career, would need to score 531 points to pass the 18,040-point mark Drexler set during his 12 years with the Blazers. Drexler, of course, did not finish his career in Portland after requesting a trade in 1995, ultimately landing with Hakeem Olajuwon and the Rockets where he won his only NBA title.</p><p>Haynes reported Drexler has shared advice with Lillard over the years; both players were also selected to the NBA&#x2019;s 75th Anniversary team earlier this year.&#xA0;Lillard said Drexler has encouraged him to stay with the Blazers during their conversations.</p><p>&#x201C;Clyde wanted to see me win in Portland,&#x201D; Lillard shared. &#x201C;But he told me to do what I had to do to be happy. He also said, &#x2018;Hold the organization accountable.&#x2019; And at that time, I was thinking I would hate to come this close and miss out on that opportunity to pass Drexler if I was to leave. I mean, I&#x2019;m right there. I definitely thought about it, but I never really believed I would be leaving Portland. It ended up all working out.&#x201D;</p><p>With a career scoring average of 24.6 points per game, Lillard could achieve the milestone accomplishment&#xA0;in roughly 22 games if he maintains that pace.</p><p>The 2022&#x2013;23 season figures to be a return to form for Lillard&#xA0;after he was limited to 29 games last season due to an abdominal injury. For his career, he has averaged 24.6 points, 6.6 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game.</p><p><strong>More NBA Coverage:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/nets-star-kevin-durant-asks-to-move-past-offseason-drama"><strong>Nets Star Kevin Durant Asks to &#x2018;Move Past&#x2019; Offseason Drama</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/video/2022/09/30/nba-stars-to-buy-pickleball-team?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">LeBron James, Kevin Love and Draymond Green To Buy Pickleball Team</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/blake-griffin-signs-celtics-report?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Blake Griffin Signs One-Year Deal With Celtics, per Report</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/nba-training-camp-five-takeaways-anthony-davis-ben-simmons-zion-williamson?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Five Takeaways From NBA Training Camp</a></strong></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzA4NTU1NDM2OTkxNjg4/usatsi_17396674-2.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bush Details Payton’s Answer When Agent Told Saints Not to Draft Him]]></title><description><![CDATA[The former New Orleans running back nearly missed out on playing in the Big Easy during his NFL career.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/bush-details-paytons-answer-when-agent-told-saints-not-to-draft-him</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/bush-details-paytons-answer-when-agent-told-saints-not-to-draft-him</guid><category><![CDATA[NFL]]></category><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Wilton Jackson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 23:28:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzA4NDIyMjkzMDA1MzQx/reggie-bush-on-draft-night.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The former New Orleans running back nearly missed out on playing in the Big Easy during his NFL career.</p><p>Reggie Bush spent 11 seasons with five different teams in his NFL career. However, the first five years of his pro football career started as an electrifying asset to the Saints&#x2019; franchise in 2006, a team that was invigorated and emotional a year after the devastation and catastrophic damage of Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>However, before the Saints drafted Bush at No. 2 in the 2006 NFL draft following an exciting college football career at USC, he spent the months leading up to the draft thinking that he was going to be selected as the first pick to the Texans. But on April 28, 2006, the night before the draft, the Texans changed their plans and then Saints coach Sean Payton wanted Bush in New Orleans.</p><p>&#x201C;My agent had been talking to Houston&#x2019;s GM Charley Casserly at the time&#x2026; the entire process,&#x201D; Bush said recently on the <a href="https://twitter.com/SInow/status/1575970024262578176"><em>I AM ATHLETE</em> podcast</a>. &#x201C;You know when you go to the [NFL] Combine&#x2026; I didn&#x2019;t even interview with the other 31 teams because they was like he was not going to be here. I only spoke to Houston. That&#x2019;s it. &#x2026; I am thinking&#x2026; I am going to Houston, looking for property down there already.&#x201D;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/SInow/status/1575970024262578176"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>When Houston instead chose Mario Williams with the No. 1 pick that year, the Texans did not give any prior warning to Bush. &#x201C;They didn&#x2019;t call us, no nothing,&#x201D; he<a href="https://twitter.com/SInow/status/1575970024262578176"> added</a>. </p><p>With the Texans off the board, New Orleans was up next and the Jets at No. 3. At the time, only eight months removed from Katrina, the Saints were without a home stadium as the Superdome was being restored following the hurricane. As a result, Bush&#x2019;s agent felt like New Orleans was not the best option for him. &#x201C;My agents were like, &#x2018;We want to go to New York.&#x2019; Third pick, big city, marketing, a lot more money,&#x201D; Bush added. </p><p>Bush was sold on the idea, and his agent told Payton not to draft the standout running back.

I&#x2019;m still here, so hopefully we can move past that,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Reports circulated earlier this summer following Durant&#x2019;s trade request that he wouldn&#x2019;t return to the franchise unless <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/28/nets-coach-steve-nash-discusses-kevin-durant-offseason-drama">general manager Sean Marks and coach Steve Nash were fired</a>.

We don&#x2019;t got that much time right now,&#x201D; he added.</p><p>Durant ultimately chose to rescind his trade request and is happy that he made the decision to remain in Brooklyn.</p><p>&#x201C;I felt like we had a good team. I felt like this is the place I said I wanted to be. We started to set something up in the future to be a solid team, so to be honest I thought this was still a great option too. I didn&#x2019;t want it to get in the way of the games being played. I still love my teammates. Still love playing in the Barclays.&#x201D;</p><p>The Nets will feature a &#x201C;Big 3&#x201D; of Durant, Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons when they open the season next month. Simmons, who was acquired from Philadelphia as part of the James Harden trade last season, has yet to play a game with the Nets due to rehabilitation of his back and personal reasons.&#xA0;</p><p>The Nets are still one of the most talented teams in the East. If they can remain healthy and put it all together, they should be taken seriously as a contender to come out of the East and make a push for a title this season.</p><p><strong>More NBA Coverage:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/video/2022/09/30/nba-stars-to-buy-pickleball-team?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">LeBron James, Kevin Love and Draymond Green To Buy Pickleball Team</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/blake-griffin-signs-celtics-report?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Blake Griffin Signs One-Year Deal With Celtics, per Report</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/nba-training-camp-five-takeaways-anthony-davis-ben-simmons-zion-williamson?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Five Takeaways From NBA Training Camp</a></strong></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxODQxMTIyNjM1NzUyOTQ2/kevin-durant-nets-closeup.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Report: Udoka Used Crude Language Toward Employee Before Relationship]]></title><description><![CDATA[The findings in the independent law firm report pave a difficult path for Udoka to return to the Celtics in ’23.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/power-dynamic-in-udokas-workplace-relationship-was-main-violation-per-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/30/power-dynamic-in-udokas-workplace-relationship-was-main-violation-per-report</guid><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sensitive]]></category><category><![CDATA[NBA]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mike McDaniel]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 22:19:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3OTYyODI1NjU1ODQ0/ime-udoka-2.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The findings in the independent law firm report pave a difficult path for Udoka to return to the Celtics in ’23.</p><p>An independent law firm that assisted with the investigation into Celtics coach Ime Udoka found that he used crude language toward a subordinate that preceded an inappropriate workplace relationship, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34697560/sources-investigation-found-boston-celtics-coach-ime-udoka-used-crude-language-dialogue-female-subordinate-prior-start-improper-relationship">according to a report from ESPN&#x2019;s Adrian Wojnarowski.</a></p><p>The Celtics organization found the language used by Udoka, a workplace superior, so troubling that it will likely make for a difficult path for him to return as coach in 2023, per Wojnarowski.

Dalvin Cook, battling a shoulder injury, will play for the Vikings in London, while Jets QB Zach Wilson makes his first start of the season.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a closer look at who&#x2019;s in and who&#x2019;s out for Week 4. </p><h3>ARIZONA CARDINALS</h3><p>The Cardinals have six players listed as questionable, including top receivers Marquise Brown (foot) and Rondale Moore (hamstring). Moore has practiced all week and looks to be good to go, and while Brown&#x2019;s late-week injury may be a bit concerning, I expect him to be available barring any setbacks. Moore&#x2019;s entrance into the offense may signify the end of Greg Dortch&#x2019;s run in fantasy, although with A.J. Green (knee) ruled out that may be extended another week. Andy Isabella took plenty of snaps last week after Green went down, so it&#x2019;s anybody&#x2019;s guess as to Arizona&#x2019;s plan at WR. It&#x2019;s a toss-up this week for fantasy production, although Brown should again be the primary target against a middle of the road Carolina pass defense. &#x2014; <em>Donnie Druin</em></p><p><a href="https://fannation.si.com/nfl/cardinals/analysis/arizona-cardinals-lb-isaiah-simmons-isnt-lost-cause">All Cardinals: </a><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/cardinals/analysis/arizona-cardinals-game-plan-defeat-carolina-panthers">Paving Arizona&#x2019;s Path to Victory Against Panthers</a></p><hr><h3>BALTIMORE RAVENS&#x200B;&#x200B;</h3><p>Ravens left tackle Ronnie Stanley did not practice Friday and was listed as questionable for the Week 4 game against the <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/buffalo-bills">Buffalo Bills</a>. Stanley did manage to practice in the previous days and was optimistic he could play Sunday. "This could very possibly be the week," he said Thursday. "I&#x2019;m very close, and I&#x2019;ll talk it over with the rest of the staff and coaches. We&#x2019;re going to make the best decision that&#x2019;s best for the team.&#x201D; The Ravens are desperately thin at left tackle after losing Ja&apos;Wuan James to a season-ending Achilles injury and Pat Mekari to a sprained ankle.</p><p>The Ravens were forced to play rookie Daniel Faalele in the Week 3 game against New England even though he had only played on the right side in college at Minnesota.<em> Fantasy: Lamar Jackson leads the league in fantasy points and accounts for 80% of the Ravens offense. </em>&#x2014; Todd Karpovich</p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/ravens/news/marlon-humphrey-ravens-secondary-flacco">Raven Country: </a><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/ravens/news/ravens-marcus-williams-paying-dividends">Signing of Marcus Williams paying dividends</a></p><hr><figure>

    </figure><h3>CAROLINA PANTHERS</h3><p>Running back Christian McCaffrey (thigh) was spotted back at practice on Friday in limited fashion after not participating the previous two days. He is deemed questionable for Sunday&#x2019;s game against Arizona but the sense is that he will be able to suit up barring any setbacks. Wide receiver Laviska Shenault (hamstring) is also questionable and will be a game-time decision. &#x2014;<em> Schuyler Callihan</em></p><hr><h3>CHICAGO BEARS</h3><p>Running back David Montgomery and cornerback Jaylon Johnson will miss Sunday&#x2019;s game after being ruled out, Montgomery with an ankle injury suffered against Houston and Johnson with a quad injury that kept him out of last week&#x2019;s win. Khalil Herbert, who gained 157 yards in Montgomery&#x2019;s place last week, will get the start at running back while undrafted rookie Jaylon Jones replaces Johnson in the nickel defense and Kyler Gordon replaces him in the base defense. It&#x2019;s expected wide receiver Velus Jones Jr. will make his NFL debut in this game after being out since Week 2 of preseason with a hamstring injury. Jones&#x2019; help is needed on offense due to the calf injury suffered by receiver Byron Pringle. It&#x2019;s also possible Jones could return some kicks or punts if the Bears deem him healthy enough. &#x2014; <em>Gene Chamberlain</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/the-method-to-luke-getsys-madness">BearDigest: Luke Getsy Tries Developing Justin Fields While Winning</a></p><hr><h3>CLEVELAND BROWNS</h3><p>Defensive tackle Taven Bryan has been ruled out against the Falcons with a hamstring injury, but both defensive ends Myles Garrett and Jadeveon Clowney are questionable. Garrett did not practice this week after his car wreck. Normally, that would immediately rule him out but he is pushing to play. It&#x2019;ll be up to the medical staff. The Browns could be down three starters in all just on the defensive line. &#x2014; <em>Pete Smith</em></p><p>Browns Digest: <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/browns/browns-maven-features/price-of-potential-is-inconsistency">The Price of Potential</a></p><hr><figure>

    </figure><h3>DETROIT LIONS</h3><p>The Lions ruled out five players for this Sunday against the Seahawks, including Amon-Ra St. Brown and D&#x2019;Andre Swift. If you can pull off a fantasy football trade for Jamaal Williams, he might be worth rostering later in the season, as Swift has struggled to remain healthy in his career. &#x2014; <em>John Maakaron</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/lions/news/lions-fans-react-dan-campbell-bobblehead">All Lions: </a><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/lions/news/dan-orlovsky-says-lions-are-playoff-team">Orlovsky says Lions are a playoff team</a></p><hr><h3>DENVER BRONCOS</h3><p>The Broncos could potentially be without three O-line starters. RT Billy Turner and RG Quinn Meinerz have been ruled out, while LG Dalton Risner is questionable for Sunday&#x2019;s action in Las Vegas. Graham Glasgow will start at RG with Cam Fleming once again taking RT. Defensively, NT D.J. Jones cleared concussion protocol and is listed as questionable for Week 4.  &#x2014; <em>Chad Jensen</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/broncos/news/russell-wilson-responds-seahawks-smear-campaign-espn">Mile High Huddle</a></p><hr><h3>GREEN BAY PACKERS</h3><p>The Packers are practically the picture of health. Only one starter is on the final injury report, though that&#x2019;s a big one with 2020 All-Pro cornerback Jaire Alexander questionable with a groin injury. That might be a big deal under normal circumstances but the Patriots won&#x2019;t have quarterback Mac Jones, so presumably Green Bay&#x2019;s defense will be just fine against Brian Hoyer. That left tackle David Bakhtiari isn&#x2019;t on the injury report at all is a huge step in his long and winding comeback. &#x2014; <em>Bill Huber</em></p><p>Packer Central: <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/packers/news/why-does-aaron-rodgers-use-so-many-timeouts">Why does Aaron Rodgers burn so many timeouts?</a></p><hr><h3>INDIANAPOLIS COLTS</h3><p>Sunday might be our first opportunity in 2022 to see Colts All-Pro linebacker Shaquille Leonard (back), who is listed as questionable for the first time this season after missing the first three games. The Colts are lacking in takeaways after forcing just two on defense so far and could really use their ball-hawking defender. Otherwise, Pro Bowl defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (elbow) is questionable, and starting free safety Julian Blackmon (ankle) is out. Rookie seventh-round pick Rodney Thomas II could get his first-career start in Blackmon&apos;s absence. Offensively, rookie offensive lineman Bernhard Raimann is the only player on the final injury report. He&apos;s been cycling in at left tackle through the first two weeks before missing last week&apos;s matchup. &#x2013; Jake Arthur</p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/colts/news/colts-texans-keys-to-victory-week-1">Horseshoe Huddle</a></p><hr><h3>JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS</h3><p>The Jaguars have mostly been able to avoid injury issues this year, but wide receiver Zay Jones popped up on the injury report with an ankle injury on Thursday. Jones has been a big part of the offense, leading it in receptions while being second in targets, yards and touchdown catches. Doug Pederson said Friday they would have a better idea closer to game time if Jones can&#x2019;t play, but if he is out, they will turn to second-year backup receiver Tim Jones. Expect Christian Kirk and Marvin Jones to be even more prominent in fantasy this week in the event Zay Jones misses Sunday&#x2019;s game vs. the Eagles. &#x2014; <em>John Shipley</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/jaguars/news/jaguars-announce-2022-53-man-roster">Jaguar Report: </a><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/jaguars/news/christian-kirk-recalls-bills-josh-allens-recruitment-pitch-before-signing-with-jaguars">Josh Allen&#x2019;s Sales Pitch for Christian Kirk</a></p><hr><p><strong>KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</strong></p><p>Once again, the Chiefs will play without three impact defenders as LB Willie Gay Jr., CB Trent McDuffie and DE Mike Danna will all miss Sunday night&#x2019;s game. Kicker Harrison Butker is officially questionable, which is good news for his progress but still too soon to reasonably see him return to a fantasy lineup. The biggest concerns are at wide receiver, where Mecole Hardman (heel) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (abdomen) were both limited during this week of practice, with Hardman listed as a DNP on Wednesday and Valdes-Scantling missing practice on Thursday. Hardman has no injury designation against the Buccaneers, but Valdes-Scantling is questionable. Hardman appeared to be impacted by his heel issue last week as well, so regardless of designation, the Chiefs&#x2019; pass-catchers are clearly banged-up headed into Week 4. &#x2014; <em>Joshua Brisco</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/news/kc-chiefs-roster-cuts-and-2022-practice-squad-tracker">Arrowhead Report: </a><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/how-the-kc-chiefs-can-best-replace-linebacker-willie-gay-jr">How the Chiefs can replace Willie Gay</a></p><hr><h3>LAS VEGAS RAIDERS</h3><p>The Raiders may be 0-3, but they get some encouraging news for this weekend. Multiple starters return, and they only lose the services of TE Foster Moreau, and WR Hunter Renfrow. The loss of Renfrow is mitigated by the rise of WR Mack Hollins who had a terrific game last week when elevated to Renfrow&#x2019;s role. On the fantasy front, I anticipate from being in the locker room this week that Derek Carr is going to have a monster day on Sunday, play him if you have him. &#x2014; <em>Hondo S.

    </figure><h3>MINNESOTA VIKINGS</h3><p>Dalvin Cook is off the injury report and will play through the shoulder injury he suffered last week. It&#x2019;s possible he won&#x2019;t be at 100%, but if you have him in fantasy, you&#x2019;re starting him. As a running back, it&#x2019;s easier to play through a shoulder injury than a lower-body injury. Za&#x2019;Darius Smith, the Vikings&#x2019; top pass rusher, will be a game-time decision with a knee injury. It would be a big loss for Minnesota&#x2019;s defense if he can&#x2019;t play, but they should still have the pieces to play well against Andy Dalton and company. &#x2014; <em>Will Ragatz</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/vikings/news/minnesota-vikings-set-initial-53-man-roster-for-2022-season">Inside The Vikings</a></p><hr><h3>NEW YORK GIANTS</h3><p>The <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> receivers unit, once thought to be a strength of the team, has certainly fallen down the charts rapidly. After losing Sterling Shepard, their most reliable receiver, to a season-ending torn ACL, the Giants will again be without Wan&#x2019;Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstring). From a fantasy perspective, that&#x2019;s not good news for quarterback Daniel Jones and the passing game, which in three games this season has yet to top 200 yards passing. The Giants are expected to bring up a receiver from their practice squad&#x2013;6-foot-1, 207-pound Marcus Johnson is the likely candidate&#x2013;as either a full promotion or as a one-week standard elevation, to help supplement the depth chart that has Kenny Golladay, Darius Slayton, Richie James and David Sills V as its only healthy receivers. &#x2014; <em>Patricia Traina</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/giants/gm-report/new-york-giants-initial-53-man-roster-moves-tracking-the-activity">Giants Country</a> </p><hr><h3>NEW YORK JETS</h3><p>Zach Wilson&apos;s sophomore season will officially begin this week against the Steelers. There&apos;s a chance New York&apos;s offense can explode with Wilson back under center, but keep in mind that the Jets are managing some significant issues on their offensive line. Starting left tackle George Fant landed on injured reserve this week, joining Duane Brown and Mekhi Becton. If Wilson can avoid some pressure, look for the second-year quarterback to utilize the weapons around him, like Garrett Wilson, Elijah Moore and Tyler Conklin, against a team that&apos;s allowed 252 passing yards per game this season. &#x2014; <em>Max Goodman</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/jets/">Jets Country</a></p><hr><h3>PHILADELPHIA EAGLES</h3><p>After not having a single player with an injury designation in the first three weeks, the Eagles have two banged up players who were ruled out for Sunday&#x2019;s game vs. the Jaguars - RB Boston Scott (rib) and CB Avonte Maddox (ankle). With Scott out, RB Trey Sermon will likely see his first action with the Eagles after the 49ers gave up on their third-round pick after only one year. UDFA safety Reed Blankenship could also be active for the first time this year because it&#x2019;s likely that Chauncey Gardner-Johnson will move into Maddox&#x2019;s slot position. Safety K&#x2019;Von Wallace, a former teammate and friend of Jags QB Trevor Lawrence, could have an increased role as well. &#x2014; <em>Ed Kracz</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/howie-roseman-reveals-seminal-moment-in-offseason-roster-construction">Eagles Today:</a> <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/miles-sanders-a-full-participant-trey-sermon-could-make-eagles-debut">Miles Sanders a Full Participant; Trey Sermon Could Make ...</a></p><hr><h3>SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS</h3><p>The 49ers&#x2019; final game status report won&#x2019;t come out until Saturday because they play Monday night, but as of now it appears guard Daniel Brunskill will play in his first game of the season &#x2013; he was a limited practice participant on Thursday and Friday. Brunskill injured his hamstring in the first preseason game, and probably won&#x2019;t be in tip-top game shape if he plays on Monday. But he has performed extremely well in the past against Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald. Without Brunskill, the 49ers&#x2019; starting guards are Aaron Banks and Spencer Burford, neither of whom have faced Donald, so Brunskill&#x2019;s presence will give the 49ers a legitimate chance to run the ball well, which they didn&#x2019;t do last week. This is a good opportunity to play Jeff Wilson Jr., Deebo Samuel and even Jordan Mason in fantasy football, because all should get carries. &#x2014; <em>Grant Cohn</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/49ers/news/instant-analysis-of-the-49ers-2022-53-man-roster">All 49ers</a></p><iframe height="600px&#x201D; frameborder=" width="100%" src="https://widget.rpb2b.com/#/americanfootball-preplay?client=sportsillustrated&panels=projection,offers&rpEventId=cf13cf82-8b48-46de-b604-9d5808b4f866&bookmakers=888_us" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><hr><h3>TENNESSEE TITANS</h3><p>The defense won&#x2019;t have safety Amani Hooker (concussion) and inside linebacker Zach Cunningham (elbow) Sunday at Indianapolis. Both are among the Titans&#x2019; leading tacklers through three games. Hooker, who got a three-year, $30 million extension at the end of training camp, is the only Tennessee player with at least one interception and one forced fumble through the first three weeks. Cunningham led the NFL in tackles in 2020, and his spot might be filled by Joe Schobert, who was signed to the practice squad at the start of the week. Schobert was the league&#x2019;s leading tackler in 2017. &#x2014; <em>David Boclair</em></p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/titans/news/tennessee-titans-nfl-preseason-ten-players-improved-standing">All Titans</a></p><p><strong>More fantasy & NFL coverage:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Week 4 Start &apos;Em, Sit &apos;Em</strong></li><ul><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/28/start-em-sit-em-week-4-quarterbacks-2022">QUARTERBACKS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/28/start-em-sit-em-week-4-running-backs-2022">RUNNING BACKS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/28/start-em-sit-em-week-4-wide-receivers-2022">WIDE RECEIVERS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/28/start-em-sit-em-week-4-tight-ends-2022">TIGHT ENDS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/28/start-em-sit-em-week-4-kickers-team-defenses-2022">KICKERS & TEAM DEFENSES</a></li></ul><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/27/waiver-wire-pickups-week-4-trevor-lawrence-zay-jones">Waiver Wire Pickups for Week 4</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/29/week-4-fantasy-football-trade-targets-josh-jacobs">Week 4 Trade Targets</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/27/dynasty-stock-watch-week-4-chris-olave-rashod-bateman-mack-hollins">Week 4 Dynasty Stock Watch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/26/good-news-bad-news-christian-mccaffrey-davante-adams">Good News, Bad News: Sanders, McCaffrey, St. Brown, Adams</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/26/top-10-week-3-fantasy-takeaways">Top 10 Week 3 Fantasy Takeaways</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/26/idp-waiver-wire-report-week-4-josey-jewell">Week 4 IDP Waiver Wire Report</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/fantasy/2022/09/26/jelani-woods-colts-week-3">Jelani Woods Emerges for Colts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/27/nfl-week-3-power-rankings-miami-dolphins-buffalo-bills-philadelphia-eagles">NFL Power Rankings: A New No. 1 Emerges in Week 3 Shakeup</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTg5MDg2MzU4MjUxMjU3/dalvin-cook.jpg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNTM4NDE1OTQ0NzA1Nzg1/christian-mccaffrey.jpg" height="345" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNTg0ODUyMDU3MzY4MzEz/perfect-10_720x380.jpg" height="327" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNTg5MDg2MzU4MjUxMjU3/dalvin-cook.jpg" height="345" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pierre Gasly Reveals Timeline for Clarity on His F1 Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Frenchman currently has a contract with AlphaTauri for 2023, but there’s rumors about the potential of him leaving for another team.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/formula1/2022/09/30/pierre-gasly-reveals-timeline-for-clarity-on-his-f1-future</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/formula1/2022/09/30/pierre-gasly-reveals-timeline-for-clarity-on-his-f1-future</guid><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Formula1]]></category><category><![CDATA[Racing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madeline Coleman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 21:30:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjg2NDczMzk5NTEwMDQ1/gasly-future.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Frenchman currently has a contract with AlphaTauri for 2023, but there’s rumors about the potential of him leaving for another team.</p><p>Silly season continues within Formula One with three seats still open, one each at Alpine, Haas and Williams.

Alabama and Michigan also face conference tests.</p><p>Feel that little crisp chill in the air? Well, maybe you don&#x2019;t if you&#x2019;re down south, but we are just about to turn the calendar to October, which means we&#x2019;re in full swing of the college football season. This week may not be heavy on great matchups, but there will be breadcrumbs for the future of the conference races to be laid this week.</p><p><em>All times ET. Watch college football with fuboTV: <a href="https://www.fubo.tv/lp/collegefootball/?irad=399332&irmp=2936331&sharedID=USA-SI-LiveDrop-NCAA_Football">Start a free trial today</a>.</em>&#xA0;</p><hr><h2>Noon</h2><h4>Kentucky at Ole Miss (-7)</h4><p>The Rebels have been winning through the air in previous seasons under Lane Kiffin, but this year, a punishing ground attack has been the calling card. Meanwhile, the opposite has been true for Kentucky, which has found some success in the passing game thanks to the arm of Will Levis. The question for the Cats is if the return of running back Chris Rodriguez gives them enough on the ground to provide true balance and make UK a legitimately tough out for the rest of the season in the SEC. </p><h4>Michigan (-11) at Iowa</h4><p>Iowa has had deep issues scoring offensive points, but their extremely opportunistic defense continues to come up huge for them, scoring two touchdowns off of turnovers last week against Rutgers. Michigan is extremely cagey about injuries, but the Wolverines will be banged up against Iowa (that has an injury bug of its own on that stout defense). Despite that, Michigan showed last week in their first game against a somewhat formidable opponent that they&#x2019;re ready to face their conference slate. </p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Midday</h2><h4>Oregon State at Utah (-10)</h4><p>The Utes will be without their best player Brant Kuthie for the rest of the season and he was the key to their impressive offense that utilizes multiple tight end sets. The Beavers are feisty this year, and just gave USC absolutely everything they could handle in a near upset last weekend. </p><h4>Wake Forest at Florida State (-7)</h4><p>The Noles are 4-0 and clicking early this season and will host a Deacons team that was plenty explosive in the loss to Clemson last week. QB Jordan Travis may have to go shot for shot with Sam Hartman, and his true evolution as a passer will be tested here. </p><h4>Oklahoma State at Baylor (-2)</h4><p>This game may end up going a long way to decide the Big 12 championship game as both Kansas and Kansas State lurk as tough outs this season. It&#x2019;s a rematch of the epic conference title game last season that had legitimate playoff implications. </p><figure>

    </figure><h4>Alabama (-17.5) at Arkansas</h4><p>The Tide will face another test after steamrolling their opponents in the last two weeks following the close shave against Texas. The Hogs came a goalpost away from beating Texas A&M last week and are looking to spring the upset over the Tide. Bama&#x2019;s toughness will be tested in this one, and they&#x2019;ll have to hold up better than they did against Texas up front.</p><h4>Texas A&M at Miss St (-4)</h4><p>That line may surprise you, but consider what Ainanas Smith&#x2019;s absence is going to mean for an A&M team that has struggled so mightily to generate explosive plays on offense. If this ends up in an air raid track meet, the Aggies might be in trouble. </p><h2>Night</h2><h4>LSU (-8.5) at Auburn</h4><p>Something seems to <em>always </em>happen in this game. This time that something might lie in Bryan Harsin&#x2019;s job security (or lack thereof) if War Eagle gets beaten decisively. It would be a big game for Brian Kelly&#x2019;s early tenure to take care of business here against a division rival. </p><figure>

    </figure><h4>NC State at Clemson (-6.5)</h4><p>This Textile Bowl has revenge all over it for the Tigers, who will host College GameDay in town for the first time in six seasons. This starts a huge few weeks of ACC play as we try to determine a clear leader in the conference title picture. DJ Uiagalele played well in the win against Wake Forest, but can he do it again in an NC State front that will ask different questions of him?</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzA1ODE3Mzk1MzQwMzE3/cade-klubnik-clemson.png"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzA1NDAyOTMwOTk2MjUz/michigan-maryland-victory-celebration.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzA1NDc4NjI5Nzk0ODQ1/braydon-johnson-ok-state_.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzA1NTA3MDgzOTUzMzUy/ap22267726937559.jpg" height="414" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mac Jones Ruled Out for Patriots vs. Packers, Brian Hoyer to Start]]></title><description><![CDATA[It will mark the veteran backup’s first start of the season.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/mac-jones-ruled-out-for-new-england-patriots-vs-green-bay-packers-brian-hoyer-to-start</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/mac-jones-ruled-out-for-new-england-patriots-vs-green-bay-packers-brian-hoyer-to-start</guid><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFL]]></category><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Daniel Chavkin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 20:42:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzA1NzE3MDAwNDc5OTQ0/mac-jones.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">It will mark the veteran backup’s first start of the season.</p><p>The&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/new-england-patriots">Patriots</a></span>&#xA0;<a href="https://www.patriots.com/news/week-4-patriots-packers-injury-report?fri">officially ruled</a> quarterback&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/college/college-football/player/mac-jones">Mac Jones</a></span>&#xA0;out for Sunday&#x2019;s game against the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</a></span>, which means backup quarterback&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/brian-hoyer">Brian Hoyer</a></span>&#xA0;is expected to get the start.</p><p>Jones first injured his ankle in the Patriots final offensive play last week vs.&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore</a></span>.

The&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/atlanta-braves">Braves</a></span>&#xA0;host the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/new-york-mets">Mets</a></span>&#xA0;in a three-game set at Truist Park in Atlanta. New York currently holds a one-game lead in the NL East, and can clinch the division&#x2014;and the No. 2 seed&#x2014;with a sweep this weekend.</p><p>It&#x2019;s true that both teams have already secured playoff berths and will have home field advantage in their first postseason round, either the wild-card or division series, but the team that wins the NL East will have a major advantage: a first-round bye. That would allow them to reset their pitching rotation, rest players who could be a little banged up after the grind of a six-month season and, most importantly, not have to worry about an early October exit.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Entering tonight&#x2019;s series opener, the Mets have a <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds">79.3% chance of winning the NL East</a>, according to FanGraphs, in no small part because of an additional wrinkle to this year&#x2019;s postseason: There will be no one-game playoffs to decide which team wins the division, as has been the case in previous seasons. Instead, there are a series of tiebreakers that determine which team finishes ahead of the other, the first of which is a head-to-head record. The Mets have won nine of their first 16 games against the Braves, so all they have to do is win one of their final three matchups with Atlanta to take the season series and earn the tiebreaker. That&#x2019;s crucial, because it gives New York an additional game cushion in the standings.</p><p>So, if the Mets win two of the three games this weekend, they would clinch as soon as Monday with either a win at home over the Nationals or a Braves loss to the Marlins. If Atlanta wins two of the three games vs. New York, the two teams technically would be tied in the standings, but essentially, the Mets would hold a one-game lead because of the tiebreaker. In this scenario, the Braves would need to win one more game than the Mets to win the NL East.</p><p>For the Braves to get the tiebreaker, they need to sweep the Mets, and that means they have to beat both New York aces, Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer, as well as Chris Bassitt, who is a really good pitcher in his own right. It seems unlikely this will happen, even with all three games coming at home and, in order, Max Fried, Kyle Wright and Charlie Morton pitching for Atlanta.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s say the Braves do win all three games, though. Everything would flip from there. They would hold the tiebreaker and have the one-game cushion. Their magic number would be one, and they could clinch the East as soon as Monday with either a win or a Mets loss. Meanwhile, the Mets would need to sweep the Nationals <em>and</em> need the Marlins to sweep the Braves to win the division.</p><p>Both teams have a lot at stake this weekend. The Braves certainly are under more pressure because they need to win all three games to have the upper hand; the Mets, though, have much more to lose. All of this because of the regular-season head-to-head tiebreaker.</p><p>The NL East, however, isn&#x2019;t the only playoff race impacted by this tiebreaker rule. The&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/san-diego-padres">Padres</a></span> can clinch one of the final two NL wild-card spots as soon as tomorrow night because they own the head-to-head advantage over the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/milwaukee-brewers">Brewers</a></span>. Right now, San Diego is three games up on Milwaukee, with both teams having six to play. But, because of the tiebreaker, any combination of three Padres wins or Brewers losses secures the Friars a playoff berth.</p><p>This wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily mean the end for Milwaukee, though. The&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/philadelphia-phillies">Phillies</a></span>&#xA0;are in shambles right now, having lost five straight games and 10 of their last 13, and their lead for the final wild card is down to just a half game. Except, there&#x2019;s that tiebreaker again. Philadelphia holds the advantage, so its lead is effectively 1.5 games.</p><hr><p>Quick programming note here before we continue.

    </figure><p>&#x201C;Ron Washington joined the Braves in 2017, signing on as third base coach after a long, winding path through the league and across the game. He brought his morning routine with him.</p><p>&#x201C;This is how that looked in spring training. His infielders had to be on the diamond each day at 7:30 a.m. Which meant that, starting around 7 a.m., their coach could enjoy a cup of coffee in the dugout in peace. This was about as strong a guarantee as Washington could get: At that hour? No one would bother the veteran coach. Sure, every organization had a few guys who liked to get to the clubhouse early, and he&#x2019;d welcome any company to join him for a cup. But there was no one who would ask him for anything. He wouldn&#x2019;t be approached by a player who wanted to run his famous infield drills or have a serious discussion about something or, hell, get ready on the field at all. No one did any of that before 7:30 a.m.</p><p>&#x201C;Except for Austin Riley.&#x201D;</p><p>That&#x2019;s how Emma Baccellieri begins <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/30/austin-riley-daily-cover">this morning&#x2019;s Daily Cover story</a>, a wonderful look at Atlanta third baseman Austin Riley&#x2019;s development from early-morning teenage prospect into one of the game&#x2019;s premier power hitters.

It&#x2019;s an exit that baseball almost never allows.</p><h2>3. WORTH NOTING from Matt Martell</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s pour one out for the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/baltimore-orioles">Orioles</a></span>&#xA0;here, whose valiant, improbable playoff push has all but officially come to an end. To make the playoffs, they need to win all six of their remaining games this season&#x2014;they have three games against the Yankees in the Bronx before finishing with three at home vs. the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/toronto-blue-jays">Blue Jays</a></span>&#x2014;and they need either the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/seattle-mariners">Mariners</a></span> or the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/tampa-bay-rays">Rays</a></span>&#xA0;to lose all of their remaining games.</p><p>Still, even though they came up short this year, the O&#x2019;s have a bright future ahead of them. Catcher Adley Rutschman and infielder Gunnar Henderson each played well in their debut seasons, and there are more top prospects on the way next season, among them starting pitchers Grayson Rodriguez and DL Hall.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been saying this since the O&#x2019;s emerged in the playoff race a few months ago that they are this year&#x2019;s version of the <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2021/09/21/are-the-mariners-for-real">2021 Mariners</a>, a young, talented team that jelled ahead of schedule but fell short of the postseason. Seattle is going to make the playoffs this season, and Baltimore has a great shot to be there in &#x2019;23.</p><p>Speaking of the Mariners, when they officially clinch a postseason berth&#x2014;which could happen as soon as tonight with a win over the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/oakland-athletics">A&#x2019;s</a></span>&#xA0;or an Orioles loss&#x2014;they will end their 21-year playoff drought.</p><h2>4. W2W4 from Nick Selbe</h2><p>Are the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/philadelphia-phillies">Phillies</a></span>&#xA0;really going to blow this? With five straight losses and 10 in their last 13 games, it sure looks like it. A four-game set against the woeful Nationals is as good a lifeline as any, and they&#x2019;ll wrap up the season with three in Houston. How the Astros decide to rest or play their starters now becomes a crucial domino in the battle for the National League&#x2019;s final playoff spot. The Brewers, meanwhile, wrap up the season against the Marlins and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/team/arizona-diamondbacks">Diamondbacks</a></span>.</p><p>The main event this weekend, though, is clearly the three-game showdown between the Braves and Mets that will all but officially determine the NL East title. The pitching matchups are juicy: Max Fried vs. Jacob deGrom on Friday, Kyle Wright vs. Max Scherzer on Saturday and Charlie Morton vs. Chris Bassitt on Sunday. Atlanta is one game back coming into the weekend, so expect Truist Park to be rocking.</p><p>Oh, and I think there&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/29/aaron-judge-al-home-run-significance">something important going on at Yankee Stadium</a> that you may or may not have already heard about &#x2026;</p><h2>5. THE CLOSER from Emma Baccellieri</h2><p>I hope by now you have seen the <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/28/richard-bleier-three-balks-one-at-bat-mets-marlins-rule">footage of poor Richard Bleier</a> getting called for three balks in one at bat Tuesday. (<em>Three</em><em>!</em> For what is essentially his normal pitching motion!) The Marlins reliever is the first pitcher on record to balk three times in a single plate appearance. Which makes it a good moment to reflect on the strangeness of the rule&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve always found the balk rule to be lacking, given the scattershot, capricious way it gets enforced (or not). It all seems so vague and open to interpretation: Can anyone really demonstrate the line&#xA0;between balk and nonbalk? But the rule itself is actually incredibly specific! The MLB rule book details 13 particular motions that should be classified as a balk ...</p><p>&#x2026; and now that I&#x2019;ve read them all, I feel like I have even <em>less</em> of an understanding of what should really constitute a balk. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-04-17-sp-2199-story.html" rel="nofollow">No wonder things got so out of hand when they tried to ramp up enforcement in 1988.</a> Happy Friday! </p><p><strong>That&#x2019;s all from us today.

Following Thursday night&#x2019;s Bengals win over the previously undefeated Dolphins, there is now just one remaining unbeaten team in the league: the 3&#x2013;0 Eagles.</p><p>Philadelphia has been very impressive to open their second season under Nick Sirianni. After a narrow 38&#x2013;35 win over the Lions, another 2022 upstart, to open the year, they blasted the Vikings 24&#x2013;7 in Week 2 and posted a 24&#x2013;8 blowout of the Commanders in Week 3.</p><p>Entering the season, many treated it as a make-or-break year for Jalen Hurts, after mixed results through his first two NFL seasons. So far, he&#x2019;s exceeded expectations, completing over 67% of his throws for 916 yards, four touchdowns and just one interception through three games. He remains incredibly dangerous as a rusher as well, with 37 carries for 167 yards and three scores.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/AlbertBreer/status/1575686973196410880"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The Eagles have done well to build around Hurts, trading for Titans star receiver AJ Brown during the NFL draft, pairing him with last year&#x2019;s first-round pick DeVonta Smith. The pair has combined for 558 yards and a pair of scores this year, with tight end Dallas Goedert emerging as a dangerous third option.</p><ul><li><strong><em><a href="https://sitickets.com/performer/philadelphia-eagles?utm_source=si-editorial&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=philadelphia-eagles">Get your seats to Philadelphia Eagles games with SI Tickets</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>The defense has stepped up as well, and currently ranks sixth in DVOA, <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-defense/2022/regular">per <em>Football Outsiders</em></a>.</p><p>Of course, Philly has a tough test&#x2014;and a very familiar face&#x2014;coming to town Sunday. The Jaguars, who look like a completely different football team under former Philadelphia coach Doug Pederson, travel to the Eagles, with Trevor Lawrence looking to build on his impressive start to the season.&#xA0;</p><p>Philadelphia is a 7.5-point favorite in Sunday&#x2019;s game, per <a href="https://www.sisportsbook.com/football/s-6/">SI Sportsbook</a>.

He also said he has not reached out or spoken to the third-year quarterback after Thursday night&#x2019;s events.</p><p>&#x201C;I never want to hurt anybody in the NFL, especially another Polynesian brother,&#x201D; the 28-year-old said, per Baby.</p><p>The injury to Tagovailoa marred what would have otherwise been a celebratory moment for Tupou: the first sack of his NFL career. The Bengals went on to win Thursday&#x2019;s game 27&#x2013;15.</p><p>Though Cincinnati triumphed at home over one of the two remaining undefeated teams in the NFL, Tagovailoa&#x2019;s injury dominated the discourse on Thursday night.&#xA0;The NFL world <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/nfl-players-tweet-prayers-concerns-for-tua-tagovailoa-after-scary-injury">sent an outpouring of thoughts and prayers</a> to the 24-year-old after veteran Teddy Bridgewater replaced him behind center for Miami.&#xA0;</p><p>The Dolphins later announced that Tagovailoa&#xA0;was transported to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. The team<a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/1575663929287905282?s=20&t=Ci9aWBpS1zisQzpCpKKdfA">&#xA0;noted</a> that he was conscious and &#x201C;has movement in all his extremities.&#x201D;</p><p>Later in the evening, the Dolphins shared that Tagovailoa <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/tagovailoa-dolphins-to-be-discharged-hospital-after-head-neck-injury">had been discharged </a>from the medical center on Thursday night and would travel back to Miami with the rest of the team. He is now in concussion protocol and&#xA0;is expected to undergo an MRI upon his return to South Florida, a<a href="https://twitter.com/JosinaAnderson/status/1575826315235557378">s first reported by Josina Anderson</a>.</p><p>Thursday&#x2019;s incident came just five days after Tagovailoa temporarily left last Sunday&#x2019;s game against the Bills after his head hit the ground on a play in the second quarter. After he stood up, he stumbled, prompting trainers to rush out onto the field and lead him back into the locker room.</p><p>Tagovailoa cleared concussion protocol at the time and was officially diagnosed with a back injury.

At Alabama, many of those dreams and aspirations were fulfilled, but your future was also thrown into flux with two high-ankle sprains that led to <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2019/01/06/tua-tagovailoa-ankle-surgery-alabama-injuries-tightrope">tightrope surgeries</a>, a broken hand and, most devastatingly, a dislocated hip that ended your college career.</p><p>And while that didn&#x2019;t stop the Dolphins from taking you as the fifth pick in the 2020 NFL draft, for whatever the reason, be it the injuries or your size or your athletic limitations, your coach and your team&#x2019;s owner your first two years never fully buy into you. You&#x2019;re yo-yo&#x2019;ed in and out of the lineup as a rookie. You break your ribs, then your finger, and miss time in your second year. Your team makes a run at <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-and-the-neverending-deshaun-watson-saga">trading for Deshaun Watson</a> in the interim, then <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/08/02/nfl-finds-dolphins-impermissible-contact-with-tom-brady-in-2019-21">pursues Tom Brady</a> after the season.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Tagovailoa suffered a head and neck injuries&#xA0; after being sacked by the Bengals&apos; Josh Tupou.<p>Katie Stratman/USA TODAY Sports</p></figcaption>
    </figure><p>But in your third year in the league, with new coach Mike McDaniel, it&#x2019;s finally all coming together. The team signs a great left tackle (Terron Armstead) and trades for a star receiver (Tyreek Hill) to round out the offense. The new staff installs a system similar to the one you excelled in at Alabama to highlight your talents. You start the season 2&#x2013;0, and you&#x2019;re playing the kings of your division, the Bills, in Week 3. Suddenly, everything has turned&#x2014;your team&#x2019;s present <em>and </em>future look bright, and a contract at $50 million per year isn&#x2019;t out of the question.</p><p>What would you have done over the past week?</p><p>Would you have self-reported concussion symptoms, if you had them, during the Bills game on Sunday? Or would you have done all you could to get yourself back out there, because it&#x2019;s football, and God knows your teammates get their bells rung plenty, playing a more physical position than you do? Would you have entered yourself into the concussion protocol with another big AFC game coming Thursday night against the Bengals? Or would you have pinned the way you stumbled to the ground against the Bills, after having your head slammed to the turf, on a balky back?</p><p>This is the reality of being an NFL player, where guys are always making bargains with their physical well-being to live out their dreams, get the highs of playing a sport that&#x2019;s unlike any other, pursue team success, build legacies and, ultimately, try to generate generational wealth.</p><p>So what Tagovailoa may have done on Sunday afternoon, Thursday night and through the time in between&#x2014;only he knows how he felt through the two hits in particular, and the period of time encompassing them in general&#x2014;is not unlike what thousands of football players have done over the years. But one of the greatest things about football, how it teaches the people who play it to keep going when things get hard, is also what can create scenes such as <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/nfl-tua-tagovailoa-injury-complicated-unsettling">the one we saw on Thursday night in downtown Cincinnati</a>.</p><p>I love football, and have since before I can remember. I think it&#x2019;s the greatest sport on the planet. Which is why I think it&#x2019;s so important that all of us ask the right questions now.</p><p>And the overarching one, to me, is whether enough was done to protect Tagovailoa from himself. Because the truth is, so many players have stories such as Tagovailoa&#x2019;s and, through no fault of their own, need that protection.</p><hr><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/28/quarterbacks-causing-nfl-parity-trevor-lawrence-mailbag">I wrote in Wednesday&#x2019;s mailbag</a> that I believed too many people would have to be complicit to keep Tagovailoa on the field on Sunday and out of the protocol on Monday&#x2014;from the Dolphins to the league, to the independent doctors, to the quarterback himself.</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to walk that back a little now, which is where my big question comes.</p><p>One thing the public may not understand is there&#x2019;s no test that definitively tells the doctors examining players on game day whether a player has a concussion. They&#x2019;re testing for symptoms and using what&#x2019;s called the SCAT5, short for Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 5th edition. There are four steps to the test: red flags, observable signs, memory assessment using Maddocks questions and examination using the Glasgow Coma Scale.</p><p>Under Step 2, observable signs, there are two check boxes: one for &#x201C;witnessed&#x201D; and the other for &#x201C;observed on video,&#x201D; meaning either applies. And one of the yes/no categories is balance/gait difficulties/motor incoordination: stumbling, slow/labored movements.</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t take a neurologist to have watched what happened after Tagovailoa had his head slammed to the turf on Sunday by Bills linebacker Matt Milano and check off the <em>yes</em> boxes.</p><p>Additionally, the NFLPA website&#x2019;s overview of the protocol has a graphic that states: &#x201C;<em>If</em> a player demonstrates gross motor instability that is determined by the team physician, in consultation with the UNC [the independent neurologist], to be neurologically caused, <em>then</em> the player is designated a No-Go.&#x201D;</p><p>Again, in this case, it&#x2019;s a slam dunk to say Tagovailoa demonstrated &#x201C;gross motor instability&#x201D; on Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium. The larger question, then, is whether that event was &#x201C;neurologically caused.&#x201D; In Tagovailoa&#x2019;s case, the team doctors could make that determination&#x2014;which, by a strict reading of the policy, they&#x2019;d be able to do&#x2014;and which could potentially undermine having an independent neurologist. There would also be the question of whether there was any follow-up testing after the game or during the week to confirm it.</p><p>Which is where another problem lies. Once Tagovailoa was cleared and went back into the game on Sunday, there wasn&#x2019;t a requirement for him to enter the concussion protocol during the week. In fact, on Monday the Dolphins actually said <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/26/dolphins-quarterback-tua-tagovailoa-avoids-concussion-protocol">Tagovailoa wasn&#x2019;t in the protocol</a>, so unless he complained of symptoms, it&#x2019;d likely be a nonissue for the team at that point.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s the loophole here. In the heat of the moment, the team doctor (or the independent neurologist) could, on paper, determine that Tagovailoa&#x2019;s stumbling was caused by his back, and not his head, and send him back into what was a very big game for the Dolphins. And then, because of that result, there&#x2019;d be no requirement for further testing, with motivation, at that point, for everyone involved (doctors, team, player, league) to confirm the original finding&#x2014;because if they were wrong on Sunday, what would that say about <em>them</em>?</p><p>And to be clear, I don&#x2019;t know that Sunday&#x2019;s event had anything to do with Thursday&#x2019;s outcome. But I also don&#x2019;t know how, at this point, you can rule it out.</p><hr><p>There&#x2019;s a scene at the end of Oliver Stone&#x2019;s <em>Any Given Sunday</em> in which linebacker Shark Lavay, played by NFL legend Lawrence Taylor, gets knocked unconscious making a play to give the Miami Sharks a win and hit a $1 million incentive in his contract.</p><p>It was the result of a lot of build-up&#x2014;team doctors had squabbled over his fitness to play after a pair of earlier concussions, coach Tony D&#x2019;Amato (played by Al Pacino) struggled with it, owner Christina Pagniacci (played by Cameron Diaz) advocated for it and, ultimately, all parties gathered in an office with Lavay signing a waiver that would take liability off the team. Lavay, along the way, implored others to let him play, because he was so close to hitting markers for the million-dollar bonus.</p><p>So as Lavay woke up after the hit in the game, still motionless, he asked D&#x2019;Amato, &#x201C;Coach, did I make the stop?&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;You stopped them cold, goddammit!&#x201D; D&#x2019;Amato responded.</p><p>The doctors then loaded Lavay onto a backboard, he smiled, and said, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you guys drop me. I&#x2019;m worth a million dollars.&#x201D;</p><p>That movie came out in 1999, and a lot has changed since then in the culture, and rules, around concussions in football.</p><p>But one thing that hasn&#x2019;t changed is that players are still making bargains with their bodies such as Stone&#x2019;s fictional linebacker did 23 years ago. It&#x2019;s not optional in the NFL. It&#x2019;s required that, to at least some degree, players do that to survive in a brutal game.</p><p>Tagovailoa showed us that, again, over the past five days.</p><p>Now it&#x2019;s important that we all ask the right questions, and get answers, on whether those around him did enough to protect him from pushing way more chips to the middle of the table than he should have. </p><p>It needs to happen not, as some are pursuing it, to the detriment of football.</p><p>It needs to happen, as I see it, for the good of football.</p><p><strong>More NFL coverage:</strong></p><p><strong>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/29/complete-list-of-nfl-future-head-coaches-daily-cover">Next Man Up: Top Coaching Candidates for 2023</a><br></strong><strong>&#x2022; </strong><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/26/nfl-week-3-ten-takeaways-jalen-hurts-mmqb">Jalen Hurts Determined to Dismiss His Doubters</a><br></strong><strong>&#x2022; </strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/26/jaguars-could-be-a-force-in-the-afc"><strong>The Jaguars Could Be for Real</strong></a><br><strong>&#x2022; <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/29/nfl-week-4-staff-expert-picks">MMQB Week 4 Staff Picks</a><br></strong><strong>&#x2022;&#xA0;</strong><strong>All Dolphins: </strong><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/dolphins/news/miami-dolphins-qb-tua-tagovailoa-injury-reaction?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Tua Gets Strong Support After Injury</a></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjg4MjMxNjUxNzQ3MDE2/tua-tagovailoa-2.jpg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzAyODIxNjU1NjUxNTI4/tupou-tua.jpg" height="345" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzAyODUxOTg4ODU3ODg1/usatsi_19115591_168398175_lowres.jpg" height="413" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Report: ESPN to Cut-In for Aaron Judge At-Bats This Weekend]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the second consecutive weekend, ESPN will alter its television coverage as the Yankees outfielder pursues history.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/30/espn-cut-in-aaron-judge-at-bats-yankees-orioles-home-run-record-college-football</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/30/espn-cut-in-aaron-judge-at-bats-yankees-orioles-home-run-record-college-football</guid><category><![CDATA[MLB]]></category><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mike McDaniel]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 17:27:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjc2NTk4NDY0MzkwODQy/aaron-judge-61.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">For the second consecutive weekend, ESPN will alter its television coverage as the Yankees outfielder pursues history.</p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/09/24/aaron-judge-cut-in-at-bats-espn-abc-wake-forest-clemson-missouri-auburn-fans-upset">For the second consecutive weekend</a>, ESPN will cut into its Saturday college football coverage for live look-ins to at-bats for Yankees outfielder&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/player/aaron-judge">Aaron Judge</a></span>, who is in pursuit of breaking Roger Maris&#x2019;s single-season American League home run record of 61.</p><p>All three Yankee games against the Orioles this weekend that are broadcast outside of the YES Network footprint will be televised on MLB Network in addition to the live cut-ins on ESPN, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewMarchand/status/1575535448767840256?s=20&t=aYt9VNh-NprXFnjryeGS9g">according to Andrew Marchand of the <em>New York Post.</em></a></p><p>Judge, who <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/29/aaron-judge-al-home-run-significance">tied the long-held record earlier this week</a> in Toronto against the Blue Jays, will continue to pursue history in the final weekend of baseball&#x2019;s regular season.

The company is at the center of a Mississippi welfare fraud case involving the former NFL quarterback, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34695437/abby-wambach-plans-exit-drug-company-linked-brett-favre-welfare-fraud-case">she told ESPN</a>&#xA0;in an email this week.</p><p>Wambach,&#xA0;a World Cup winner and two-time gold medalist with the USWNT,&#xA0;was a member of the sports advisory board for Odyssey Health, a drug company that has said it is developing a nasal spray&#xA0;to treat concussions.&#xA0;Favre is&#xA0;Odyssey Health&#x2019;s top investor.</p><p>According to a lawsuit filed by the state of Mississippi, $2.1 million that was supposed to be given to welfare recipients was instead directed toward Odyssey Health.&#xA0;The company, previously known as Prevacus, was connected to the fraud case when arrests were first made in 2020, as reported by&#xA0;<a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/13/phil-bryant-brett-favre-welfare/">Anna Wolfe of <em>Mississippi Today</em></a>.</p><p>In an email Thursday, Wambach indicated she wasn&#x2019;t aware of the&#xA0;&#x201C;disturbing information&#x201D; about Odyssey Health until ESPN reached out to her for comment.</p><p>&#x201C;Minutes after learning this new information, I initiated the process to immediately and fully divest myself from any involvement&#x2014;financial and otherwise&#x2014;with Prevacus/Odyssey Health Inc., a process that I insisted be complete by end of day today,&#x201D; Wambach said in the email.</p><p>Wambach did not respond to ESPN&#x2019;s request for an interview or to questions about what her role on the advisory board entailed. She said in her email that she joined the board because she supported the company&#x2019;s efforts&#xA0;to lessen the impact of concussion-related injuries.</p><p>&#x201C;Since I genuinely believed this company was being transparent about a product that could spare the next generation of athletes from the severe impact of concussion injuries that I endured as a professional athlete, I am profoundly angry, disappointed, and saddened by what I learned today,&#x201D; Wambach wrote.</p><p>The state of Mississippi has filed a lawsuit against Favre and several others to recover millions in misspent state funds that were intended to help individuals on welfare. The suit implicating Favre states the former quarterback used welfare money to fund a <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/14/brett-favre-welfare-scheme-new-texts">university volleyball arena at Southern Miss</a>,&#xA0;his alma mater and where his daughter played college volleyball and beach volleyball.</p><p>Text messages obtained by <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/13/phil-bryant-brett-favre-welfare/"><em>Mississippi Today</em></a> show Favre, former governor Phil Bryant, nonprofit founder Nancy New and former welfare agency director John Davis worked together to funnel at least $5 million of the state&#x2019;s welfare funds toward the building of the stadium. In the texts, <a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyNBC12/status/1569813133442666497?s=20&t=5-y5gL5xA_LYFw4m9eVk-g">Favre reportedly asks New</a> whether any money he&#x2019;d received for the volleyball stadium can be traced back to its source by the media. New said no, saying she understands why Favre would be &#x201C;uneasy about that.&#x201D;</p><p>New has already pleaded guilty to 13 felony counts related to the fraud case in which nonprofit leaders misspent at least $77 million in money that was earmarked to aid those in need, <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/09/13/phil-bryant-brett-favre-welfare/">according to Wolfe</a>.</p><p>New is helping the prosecution as part of her plea deal and says she worked to help Favre at the instruction of Bryant. The messages also show that reportedly received a separate $1.1 million welfare contract to promote the program, with Favre offering to &#x201C;record a few radio spots.&#x201D; However, he did not do the radio appearances.</p><p><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/22/john-davis-brett-favre-welfare-fraud-scandal-mississippi-pleads-guilty">Davis recently pleaded guilty</a> to two federal charges, including one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal loans and one count of theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-executive-director-mississippi-department-human-services-pleads-guilty-conspiring">release from the U.S. Department of Justice</a>.</p><p>Favre has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing and has <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/07/14/former-mississippi-governor-allegedly-ordered-payments-brett-favre">reportedly repaid the $1.1 million</a>.

I&apos;m a Native Hawaiian, have family there and like everybody from Hawaii, we all have an irrational love for other Hawaiians. I suppose every state has some kind of state pride, identity or culture. It may just feel like to me that most people aren&apos;t aware of what that is for Hawaiians since most of the stereotypes are about the beaches, surfing or hula dancing. When really it&apos;s an amalgam of shared histories between many different nations and parts of the world.<br><br>So from Tagovailoa to Marcus Mariota to DeForest Buckner, I have a soft spot for them all. I don&apos;t have anything more interesting to say than what&apos;s already out there and I&apos;m not educated enough about head trauma or ways the NFL and NFLPA could better prevent these types of injuries. It was just a really gut-wrenching result and it&apos;s a sobering reminder of what these athletes put on the line with every snap of the football. I&apos;m wishing Tua all the best and I&apos;m sure he&apos;s receiving support from millions. And while I&apos;m wishing people well, my heart goes out to those dealing with life after Hurricane Ian, including my former SI colleague Dr. Roto, who lives in that part of Florida.</p><p>  So in this Week 4 Cheat Sheet, I don&apos;t want to spend much time focusing on the marquee fantasy players across the league, and instead I want to focus on borderline players who are either at the end of your starting lineup, the end of your bench or near the top of a 12-team league&apos;s waiver wire.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>1. Chasing Chase Claypool</h3><p>Relying on&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/diontae-johnson">Diontae Johnson</a></span>&#xA0;this season is stressful enough given he has yet to find the end zone. I&apos;m asking you to ramp the anxiety up a notch by trusting&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/college/college-football/player/chase-claypool">Chase Claypool&#xA0;</a></span>to have a great Week 4. Yes, the same Claypool who has a whopping 11 catches for 79 yards this season. I know it&apos;s not easy to watch&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/mitchell-trubisky">Mitchell Trubisky</a></span>&#xA0;put a hard cap on this offense&apos;s potential, but I&apos;m drawn to this matchup because of the matchup against the Jets.<br><br>New York ranks 32nd in defense DVOA and 32nd in pass DVOA. In Week 1, they allowed Devin Duvernay and Rashod Bateman to combine for six receptions for 113 yards and three touchdowns. In Week 2, it was Amari Cooper&apos;s turn, as he posted nine receptions on 10 targets for 101 yards and a score. Finally in Week 3, the Bengals trio of Ja&apos;Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Tyler Boyd combined for 15 catches on 22 targets for 227 yards and two scores.<br><br>Long story short, you should give all the Steelers wideouts a bump up in your rankings this week. We&apos;re just hoping Trubisky can funnel some of that love to Claypool.</p><h3>2. That&apos;s Njoku For You</h3><p>In Week 4,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/david-njoku">David Njoku</a></span>&#xA0;and the Browns have the Falcons on tap. Atlanta&apos;s TE points allowed thus far is a bit skewed because&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/taysom-hill">Taysom Hill</a></span>&#xA0;rushed four times for 81 yards and a touchdown. Safe to say Njoku probably won&apos;t get carries, let alone a long touchdown run. Njoku did not practice Thursday and the Friday injury report isn&apos;t ready yet. It&apos;s possible he won&apos;t play because of a knee injury. If that&apos;s the case, then apply what I&apos;m saying to backup TE Harrison Bryant, who&apos;s made a few plays this year.&#xA0;<br><br>I&apos;m interested to see how the Falcons use LB Deion Jones this week as he likely will return from injured reserve. Atlanta has two pretty good coverage linebackers, Mykal Walker and Rashaan Evans, but inserting a rusty Jones into the starting lineup could create some busted coverage plays for Njoku to exploit. Atlanta ranks 24th in pass DVOA but that has more to do with a lack of consistent pass rush. Through three games, the Falcons have seven sacks and they&apos;re ranked sixth-worst in pass rush grade by PFF.&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/jacoby-brissett">Jacoby Brissett</a></span>&#xA0;is ninth in passer rating according to NFL Next Gen Stats, which is far better than most would give him credit for. We just have to hope Njoku is able to play this week.</p><figure>

href="https://www.si.com/nba/team/boston-celtics">Celtics</a></span>&#xA0;have signed veteran forward&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/blake-griffin">Blake Griffin</a></span>&#xA0;to a one-year, fully guaranteed contract, <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1575868141493579776">according to ESPN&#x2019;s Adrian Wojnarowski.</a></p><p>The 33-year-old Griffin spent last season with the Nets, where he averaged career lows in points (6.4), rebounds (4.1), field goal attempts (5.6) and minutes per game (17.1). It was the first year of Griffin&#x2019;s career in which he averaged less than double-digit points per game.</p><p>The signing of Griffin comes as Boston searches for frontcourt depth entering the new basketball season. Danilo Gallinari, who was expected to play a major role off the Celtics&#x2019; bench this season, <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/02/boston-celtics-danilo-gallinari-diagnosed-torn-acl">tore his ACL at the FIBA World Cup Qualifying</a>&#xA0;and will miss the season.&#xA0;</p><p>Meanwhile, starting center Robert Williams will miss the first couple months of the season after <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/29/robert-williams-celtics-knee-injury-ime-udoka">having a second knee surgery</a> to address a meniscus injury that he suffered in the spring.&#xA0;</p><p>Williams had his meniscus trimmed towards the end of the regular season, and returned to play limited minutes in the playoffs as the Celtics made the NBA Finals. His second surgery was to address lingering soreness in his knee.</p><ul><li><strong><em><a href="https://sitickets.com/performer/boston-celtics?utm_source=si-editorial&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=boston-celtics">Get your seats to Boston Celtics games with SI Tickets</a></em></strong></li></ul><p>Boston has reportedly been giving veteran Luke Kornet a look in camp with the starting five in the wake of Williams&#x2019;s absence, but Boston is thin behind him with the injuries in the frontcourt. In addition, news broke shortly after the reported Griffin signing that Kornet suffered a minor ankle sprain in practice this week and will miss one-to-two weeks, <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredweissnba/status/1575878386865434624?s=46&t=Bcc02ch-MVglHIno62_Adg">according to Jared Weiss of <em>The Athletic.</em></a></p><p>While Griffin is certainly not the high-flying athletic player he once was, he can still provide offense for Boston as a stretch four off the bench. It is harder to predict Griffin&#x2019;s fit defensively in the Celtics&#x2019; switch-heavy scheme, as his defense has been a net negative as he progresses to the late stages of his career.</p><p><strong>More NBA Coverage:&#xA0;</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/29/demar-derozan-lakers-done-deal-until-russell-westbrook-trade?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">DeRozan Thought He Was Joining Lakers Until Westbrook Trade</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/29/mike-breen-house-fire-long-island-espn?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Home of NBA Announcer Mike Breen Destroyed in Massive Fire</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/09/29/athletes-celebrating-national-coffee-day?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Happy National Coffee Day to These Sports Figures</a></strong></li><li><strong>Inside The Celtics:&#xA0;<strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/celtics/top-stories/joe-mazzulla-discusses-dynamic-working-with-celtics-coaching-staff-mostly-brought-on-by-ime-udoka?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Joe Mazzulla Discusses Dynamic Working with Celtics&#x2019; Coaching Staff Mostly Brought on by Ime Udoka</a></strong>&#xA0;</strong></li></ul><p><em>For more Boston Celtics coverage, go to&#xA0;</em><em><a href="http://Insidetheceltics.com?utm_source=recommendations&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=end-of-story">Inside The Celtics</a>.</em><em>&#xA0;</em></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTc5OTMyOTAwMzM3MTMyODg4/blake-griffin-nets.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Report: Jonathan Majors in Talks to Play Dennis Rodman]]></title><description><![CDATA[The film will chronicle Rodman's Las Vegas vacation in the middle of the 1998 NBA Finals.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/09/30/jonathan-majors-in-talks-to-play-dennis-rodman-48-hours-in-vegas-chicago-bulls-1998-nba-finals-report</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/09/30/jonathan-majors-in-talks-to-play-dennis-rodman-48-hours-in-vegas-chicago-bulls-1998-nba-finals-report</guid><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><category><![CDATA[Extra Mustard]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Daniel Chavkin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 15:49:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNzAwNzk5MjYzMTg4MTY4/dennis-rodman.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The film will chronicle Rodman's Las Vegas vacation in the middle of the 1998 NBA Finals.</p><p>A major Hollywood star may be set to play Dennis Rodman on the big screen. <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/09/jonathan-majors-dennis-rodman-lionsgate-vegas-1235130204/">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, actor Jonathan Majors is in talks to play Rodman in the upcoming movie <em>48 Hours in Vegas</em>.</p><p>Majors is most known for his role as Kang in Marvel&#x2019;s <em>Loki </em>and Atticus Freeman in HBO&#x2019;s <em>Lovecraft Country</em>.

Tagovailoa was eventually stretchered off the field and taken to a local hospital. </p><p>According to updates from the Dolphins, Tua suffered head and neck injuries, was conscious and had movement in all his extremities, and flew home with the team.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/1575662129205870592"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/1575663929287905282"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/1575691590638927874"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The injury generated massive controversy because of what happened to Tagovailoa just four days earlier when Miami played Buffalo.</p><p>In that game, Tua was shoved to the ground and ended up banging his head on the turf, which led to his stumbling around, collapsing and having to be held up by his teammates.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BrownsRally/status/1574102349492125697"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The independent evaluators who do concussion testing for NFL teams concluded Tua had a back injury and cleared him to go back into the game.</p><p>Now, those of us who aren&#x2019;t doctors and don&#x2019;t have medical degrees should not make medical judgments, but we can be skeptical in watching that video above, to say the least.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s why whenever anyone talks about what happened to Tagovailoa on Thursday night, they must cite what happened to him against Buffalo. It cannot and should not be ignored.</p><p>However, that&#x2019;s just what the Amazon Prime Video halftime crew of Charissa Thompson, Tony Gonzalez, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Richard Sherman did. There was no discussion of Tua playing in a game four days after he left a game because of a hard hit. The crew just offered thoughts and prayers and lectured the audience that Tua&#x2019;s health is all that matters, as if we didn&#x2019;t already know that.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not asking the panel to speculate or play doctor, but you also can&#x2019;t pretend that what happened four days ago didn&#x2019;t happen. It&#x2019;s a disservice to viewers to not tell the entire story.</p><p>Prime Video&#x2019;s halftime show faced major blowback on Twitter after taking a pass on giving the full details of the story. Someone at Amazon, I assume, must have been paying attention to the response because, lo and behold, in the middle of the third quarter, Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit gave a light summary of what happened to Tua and mentioned the incident in the Buffalo game, although they cut the video off right before Tua started stumbling around.</p><p>For as big as a miss the halftime show was, the postgame show came through big time, mainly thanks to Michael Smith, who was not on the halftime panel. Smith came with facts and details about concussion protocol, what happened in the Buffalo game and responses from the players&#x2019; union. He was measured, thorough and went in-depth on all the details.</p><p>On another positive note for Amazon, sideline reporter Kaylee Hartung did an excellent job with her reporting and with keeping viewers updated on what was going on with Tua.</p><p>This is not a story the NFL wants all over game coverage. Concussions are a controversial topic. The existence of <em>Thursday Night Football</em>, with players back out on the field after getting just three days of rest, is a controversial topic. And the visual of the injury itself Thursday was terrifying.</p><p>Part of me was willing to give the halftime show a little bit of a pass, because the networks are likely going to lean toward making their league partners happy. But that theory doesn&#x2019;t hold up since Michaels and Herbstreit, and then Amazon&#x2019;s postgame show, went into detail about the incident Sunday. The bottom line is it was just a failure by the halftime show.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Given the show airs on the NFL&#x2019;s own network, <em>Good Morning Football</em> deserves credit for covering all the ugly details of the Tua controversy on Friday&#x2019;s show.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/gmfb/status/1575807246939803648"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>And for those of you who have asked why more people in sports media didn&#x2019;t call out the handling of the Tua, one person who has ranted about it every day this week on his SiriusXM show and <em>First Take</em> is Chris &#x201C;Mad Dog&#x201D; Russo.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/MadDogUnleashed/status/1574538925560844288"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><strong>3. </strong>While everyone was watching Dolphins-Bengals on Thursday, Utah State was playing BYU on ESPN, and the game featured a 15-yard penalty for shoe throwing.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nocontextcfb/status/1575648732929961984"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The internet rule is that any time any athlete throws a shoe, this clip must be posted.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/an0bVaTjF_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><strong>4. </strong>Here&apos;s a great quote from Twins shortstop Carlos Correa, comparing himself to Dior, on whether Minnesota can re-sign him.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/Fox9Sports/status/1575600193831337984"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><strong>5. </strong>A big topic on the latest <em>SI Media Podcast</em> (see the next item) was the over-the-top reaction from college football fans who were angry that ESPN cut into last week&#x2019;s Clemson&#x2013;Wake Forest game to split-screen at bats from Aaron Judge.

While training camp comes with hope for every organization&#x2014;except for apparently the Spurs, whom <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2022/09/26/gregg-popovich-blunt-claim-spurs-title-hopes">Gregg Popovich does not believe would be a good title bet</a>&#x2014;some preseason happenings are more important than others. Here are five takeaways from the first week of training camp &#x2026; </p><h2>Anthony Davis&#x2019;s Shooting</h2><p>An early revelation from&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/team/los-angeles-lakers">Lakers</a></span>&#xA0;camp is that&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a></span>&#xA0;said he p<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/34686509/los-angeles-lakers-anthony-davis-says-undisclosed-wrist-injury-hurt-long-range-shooting-last-season" rel="nofollow">layed much of last season with a wrist injury</a>. </p><p>"A lot of people don&apos;t know this, but since January I was battling a wrist injury the whole year," Davis told reporters. "So it was affecting my shot and everything. That&apos;s not an excuse but it was tough for me to shoot how I wanted to shoot. I couldn&apos;t really follow through."</p><p>In a weird way, this could be good news for the Lakers, because it would at least offer some explanation for Davis&#x2019;s shooting drop off in 2022. AD shot only 18.6% from three last season, the worst mark in his career for a season he attempted at least one a game. He connected on a dispiriting 17.5% of his catch-and-shoot threes, and for good measure, he also struggled on midrange Js, converting 36.9% of his shots from that range. </p><p>The Lakers certainly need the better shooting version of AD to have any hope of being a serious contender this season. Even if Davis can&#x2019;t reach the heights he did during the <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2020/10/12/lakers-win-2020-nba-championship-daily-cover">team&#x2019;s Bubble championship run</a>, shooting as poorly as he did last year would be a death knell for a Los Angeles team with a chaotic roster construction. As long as the Lakers&#x2019; spacing is cramped, AD will need to open up the floor for himself. If the wrist injury was truly the source of his struggles, it&#x2019;s welcome news that Davis says he feels 100% healthy ahead of this year. </p><iframe height="400" width="400" src="https://omny.fm/shows/open-floor-sis-nba-show/messy-media-day-roundup/embed?size=square" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><h2>Ben Simmons at the Five</h2><p>For those hoping to see&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/ben-simmons">Ben Simmons</a></span>&#xA0;take on a Draymond Green-esque role for the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/team/brooklyn-nets">Nets</a></span>, good news: Simmons and the coaching staff both seem up to the idea. When asked about Simmons playing center for Brooklyn when he finally gets on the floor, both Steve Nash and the man himself responded affirmatively. </p><p>&#x201C;If he&#x2019;s the lone big, that&#x2019;s a role we would definitely play him at,&#x201D; Nash said about putting Simmons at the five. &#x201C;But he&#x2019;s also our playmaker and point guard.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;I love playing the five,&#x201D; Simmons said this week. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201D;</p><p>Simmons at center is both a smart use of his talents and a necessity for the Nets. Brooklyn&#x2019;s only returning big is Nic Claxton, who while talented, can be a liability at times because of his free-throw shooting. Day&#x2019;Ron Sharpe could get some run, but he&#x2019;s unproven. And&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/markieff-morris">Markieff Morris</a></span>&#xA0;will likely get some minutes too, but he&#x2019;s undersized. </p><p>Simmons has had success before when flanked with shooters. And in Brooklyn, he could be flanked by&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/kevin-durant">Kevin Durant</a></span>,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/kyrie-irving">Kyrie Irving</a></span>,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/seth-curry">Seth Curry</a></span>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/joe-harris">Joe Harris</a></span>&#xA0;all at once. Theoretically, a lineup like that finally opens up Simmons to pass, cut, screen, run the floor and defend while not having to worry about clogging the floor because of all the space his teammates can provide. It&#x2019;s a Simmons hypothetical that has always sounded tantalizing, and one that wasn&#x2019;t quite realistic in Philadelphia because of the awkward fit with&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/joel-embiid">Joel Embiid</a></span>. While a new version of Simmons is still a ways from reality, at least everyone is acknowledging an interest in trying it out. Whether Brooklyn has the guts to go that small against a team like, say the Sixers, will be fascinating to watch. </p><h2>Jimmy Butler Not at the Four</h2><p>While we&#x2019;re on position watch, what are the Heat doing to replace the loss of&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/p-j-tucker">P.J. Tucker</a></span>? Apparently,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/jimmy-butler">Jimmy Butler</a></span>&#xA0;isn&#x2019;t keen on picking up all of the slack. </p><p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care about those speculations, I don&#x2019;t play the four," Butler said on Media Day when asked if he would slide up to Tucker&#x2019;s old position. &#x201C;I could play the four, yes. If they absolutely need me to play the four I could yes. If they absolutely wanted to have a conversation about playing the four, I could yes. But I&#x2019;m not playing the four.&#x201D;</p><p>While Butler&#x2019;s comments were partially tongue-in-cheek&#x2014;he did play some four for Miami in the postseason&#x2014;he has a point. Playing him at power forward in the regular season would be a risk for the Heat, who can&#x2019;t burden their star to that level before the playoffs. </p><p>So who <em>has</em> been taking the reps? Caleb Martin is the clubhouse leader to play the position, unless Miami can go out and get someone like Jae Crowder. Like Tucker, Martin is undersized, though the similarities end there. The pros are Martin is athletic, can defend wings, make plays in transition and has a promising jump shot. The concerns are if he can guard bigger players the way Tucker was frequently called upon to do, and if he can make up for the communication and intangibles Tucker brought to the team. </p><p>The Heat largely brought back the same roster from the squad that nearly made the 2022 Finals. It feels like a dicey proposition with the improvements made elsewhere in the conference. Counting on internal improvement from Martin is a gamble. </p><p><strong><em><a href="https://www.fubo.tv/lp/StreamTV/stream-espn-disney-abc-online/?v=nbaonespn&irad=950486&irmp=2936331&sharedID=USA-SI-LiveDrop-NBA_ESPNLiveDropGenATI">Watch the NBA all season long with fuboTV.

Still, in his first NBA-sanctioned game since 2021, Wiseman had a promising comeback for the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/team/golden-state-warriors">Warriors</a></span>&#xA0;in their preseason exhibition against the Wizards in Japan. Playing in 24 minutes, Wiseman scored 20 points on 8-of-11 shooting, adding eight rebounds, a block and an assist. The former No. 2 pick rather surprisingly sat out all of last season, missing out on the Warriors&#x2019; championship run after knee surgery also cut his rookie campaign short. </p><p>After losing a couple vets from the title rotation, it&#x2019;s clear Golden State&#x2019;s front office is hoping for some contributions from the young players to mount its title defense. Wiseman, if healthy, can bring the team a new dimension with his skillset. At this point, it&#x2019;s not worth haggling over whether Wiseman can live up to the pedigree of being a No. 2 overall pick. All that matters is if he can be a valuable part of a contending team, and at least on paper, he&#x2019;s an exciting fit next to the Warriors&#x2019; core. </p><p>Wiseman&#x2019;s soft touch could allow him to add a shooting component lacked by the Dubs&#x2019; other bigs. He&#x2019;s also more athletic than Draymond Green and Kevon Looney, which means he could be a kind of vertical pick-and-roll threat Stephen Curry has not really played with during this dynastic era. </p><p>A well-rounded Wiseman really could extend the Warriors&#x2019; championship window. Though it&#x2019;s a lot of pressure on a young player to be counted on to help keep a dynasty rolling, Wiseman at least took the literal first step by getting on the floor in Tokyo. </p><h2>Zion Williamson Dominates</h2><p>How good was&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/zion-williamson">Zion Williamson</a></span>&#xA0;during the Pelicans&#x2019; first five-on-five scrimmage of camp? Larry Nance Jr. told reporters Zion didn&#x2019;t even know he hadn&#x2019;t missed a shot. </p><p>&#x201C;He looks like Z," Nance Jr. said after the practice. "Dude hasn&apos;t played basketball for 500-something days. It&apos;s not like none of us are expecting that right away but shoot, I got to be honest with you, dude looks good. It&apos;s going to take time for everybody to adjust to him. It&apos;s going to take him time to adjust to everybody, but it&apos;s hard not to be impressed."</p><p>Head coach Willie Green added Williamson played alongside C.J. McCollum,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/brandon-ingram">Brandon Ingram</a></span>, Herb Jones and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/player/jonas-valanciunas">Jonas Valanciunas</a></span>&#xA0;in the scrimmage, the quintet expected to be the Pels&#x2019; starting five. It&#x2019;s hard not to be encouraged that Williamson not only took part, but excelled playing alongside a group that had its own success down the stretch of last season. Green will have to find a delicate balance this year, deploying the massive talent of Williamson while also continuing to harness the effectiveness of the players who led the Pels to the playoffs. </p><p>Of course, Williamson will need to prove he can thrive against actual opponents. And there are certainly question marks defensively about that projected starting group. But considering it was only a few months ago Zion was allegedly an injured flight risk, him being healthy and gelling with the starters is a good place to be.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>More NBA Coverage:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/27/celtics-ime-udoka-suspension-jayson-tatum-jaylen-brown-marcus-smart">Celtics Open Camp With Many Questions</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/26/los-angeles-lakers-russell-westbrook-nba-media-day-lebron-james-anthony-davis">The Lakers Have a Russell Westbrook-Sized Elephant in the Room</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/19/nba-eastern-conference-tiers-bucks-celtics-nets-76ers">NBA Eastern Conference Tiers: Bucks-Celtics Remain Supreme</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/20/nba-western-conference-tiers-warriors-clippers-nuggets-suns">NBA Western Conference Tiers: Warriors Remain in Driver&#x2019;s Seat</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2022/09/26/brooklyn-nets-kevin-durant-kyrie-irving-media-day">Kevin Durant and the Nets Are Back to Normal &#x2026; for Now</a></strong></li></ul>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjk5Nzc3ODY2MDE1Nzcz/anthony-davis-lakers-training-camp.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Week 4 NFL Odds and Best Bets: Picks for Perfect 10 Contest]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our experts provide their Week 4 best bets for SI Sportsbook’s Perfect 10 contest.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/betting/2022/09/30/week-4-nfl-odds-perfect-10-contest-si-sportsbook</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/betting/2022/09/30/week-4-nfl-odds-perfect-10-contest-si-sportsbook</guid><category><![CDATA[Fantasy/Betting]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFL]]></category><category><![CDATA[Betting]]></category><category><![CDATA[sisbperfect]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFL Betting]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Frankie Taddeo]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 15:00:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjg2MjY4MzE0ODIxNjYx/cooepr-rush.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Our experts provide their Week 4 best bets for SI Sportsbook’s Perfect 10 contest.</p><p>As the calendar flips to October, that means our kids will be receiving &#x2018;free&#x2019; candy with Halloween later this month. </p><p>Who doesn&#x2019;t love &#x2018;free&#x2019; things?! </p><p>How about a &#x2018;Free&#x2019; NFL contest where you can win $10,000?</p><p>SI Sportsbook is offering a &#x2018;free&#x2019; sports betting contest every week of the NFL season!

Let&#x2019;s see who our team is backing as their best bets for the Week 4 contest.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/ellenport" rel="nofollow">Craig Ellenport:</a> Bills -3.5</h4><p>It&#x2019;s easy to sell this game as a battle of elite quarterbacks that can go either way, but the Bills are a better team and they have a greater sense of urgency this week after losing to the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/miami-dolphins">Dolphins</a></span>. And the difference will be Buffalo&#x2019;s defense. After the Dolphins scored 42 against Baltimore two weeks ago, Buffalo held Miami to 21.&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/josh-allen">Josh Allen</a></span>&#xA0;and the Bills&#x2019; offense should score plenty, so Buffalo just needs to slow down&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a></span>&#xA0;a little to come away with a comfortable win.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/MattEhalt" rel="nofollow">Matt Ehalt:</a> Cowboys -2.5</h4><p>The Cowboys laying just 2.5 points against the Commanders seems like free money.&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/cooper-rush">Cooper Rush</a></span>&#xA0;has proven he can competently handle the offense and has already beaten the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/cincinnati-bengals">Bengals</a></span>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/new-york-giants">Giants</a></span>. The Commanders are still a mess and already lost on the road at the Lions. Dallas is riding high off back-to-back wins and should be able to beat Washington by at least a field goal.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/Shawn__Childs" rel="nofollow">Shawn Childs:</a> Lions -6.5</h4><p>Typically laying points by a team that allows 31 points a game is a losing play. When adding that Detroit only has four wins over 20 matchups under Dan Campbell, bettors should run to the window and take Seattle plus the points on Sunday. Last year, Detroit started to feature Amon-Ra St. Brown in its offense in Week 13. They went 4-1 straight at home since that point while scoring 167 points (33.4 per game) with wins over the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/minnesota-vikings">Vikings</a></span>,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/arizona-cardinals">Cardinals</a></span>, Packers and Commanders. The Seahawks&#x2019; defense couldn&#x2019;t get offenses off the field in 2021, and they are trending in a similar direction this season (allowing 4.9 yards per rush and 8.9 yards per pass attempt). Detroit will be without D&#x2019;Andre Swift, and their defense has a lot to prove late in games. In Week 17 last year,&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a></span>&#xA0;beat the Lions, 51-29, in his final home start for Seattle.&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/geno-smith">Geno Smith</a></span>&#xA0;will make a mistake or two in this matchup, helping Detroit even its record at 2-2 in this revenge matchup. </p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/mattkdelima" rel="nofollow">Matt De Lima:</a> Seahawks +6.5</h4><p>The Lions have leaned hard on the run and it&#x2019;s worked to their benefit with D&#x2019;Andre Swift and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/jamaal-williams">Jamaal Williams</a></span>. But I believe we see a regression towards the mean as Detroit is banged up between Swift, two interior linemen, Amon-Ra St. Brown and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/t-j-hockenson">T.J. Hockenson</a></span>. They could still all play but, at the very least, it&#x2019;s presumptive to assume Jared Goff is suddnely a steady and reliable quarterback that puts 30-plus on the scoreboard weekly. Seahawks do enough to lose yet cover.</p><figure>

    </figure><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/Kkylewood" rel="nofollow">Kyle Wood:</a> Cowboys -2.5</h4><p>The Cowboys lead the NFL in sacks and Carson Wentz is the most-sacked quarterback in the league. It&#x2019;s the perfect storm for Dallas&#x2019; defensive line to feast on the Commanders&#x2019; spotty protection of Wentz and force a turnover or two. On the other side of the ball, the Cowboys ran with impunity last week against the Giants and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/college/college-football/player/ceedee-lamb">CeeDee Lamb</a></span>&#xA0;finally came alive. Cooper Rush is still undefeated as a starter and Washington, which has dropped two in a row, is not ending that streak in Dallas. I feel plenty comfortable with this line less than a field goal.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/jenpiacenti" rel="nofollow">Jennifer Piacenti:</a> Lions -6.5</h4><p>I am officially buying into the hype. The Lions are 3-0 ATS this year and face a Seahawks team averaging 15.7 points per game. Even though the Lions defense&#x2019; is generous, I don&#x2019;t see Geno Smith taking full advantage. Meanwhile, Jamaal Williams should be a more than capable replacement for D&#x2019;Andre Swift versus a porous Seattle run defense, and Amon-Ra St. Brown remains a top wideout that will be prominently featured. Throw in&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/josh-reynolds">Josh Reynolds</a></span>, T.J. Hockenson, and D.J. Chark, and suddenly Jared Goff looks like the quarterback with better weapons (apologies to&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/dk-metcalf">DK Metcalf</a></span>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/player/tyler-lockett">Tyler Lockett</a></span>). The Lions average 31.7 points per game&#x2014;second-most in the NFL&#x2014;and they cover again Sunday. </p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/connor__lamb">Connor Lamb</a>: Seahawks +6.5</h4><p>Geno Smith looked more comfortable putting the ball in the hands of Seattle&#x2019;s best offensive playmakers in Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf last week against the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/atlanta-falcons">Falcons</a></span>, targeting the duo 23 times for 14 catches and 1 touchdown. This improved rapport should help open up the rushing lanes for Pete Carroll&#x2019;s preferred run-heavy game script against a Lions team that is allowing 142.3 rushing yards per contest. Detroit hasn&#x2019;t been a favorite since Week 11 of 2020 when they lost 20-0 to the&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/carolina-panthers">Panthers</a></span>, and although they are 3-0 ATS this year, Vegas has a mysterious way of balancing advantageous trends throughout a season.</p><h4><a href="https://twitter.com/Frankie_Fantasy" rel="nofollow">Frankie Taddeo:</a> Packers -9.5</h4><p>The Patriots were not a great team before Mac Jones suffered his ankle injury. Now they will start Brian Hoyer, who is 0-11 in his last 11 starts dating back to 2016, against one of the league&#x2019;s best defenses. New England is 0-4-1 ATS in its last five road games and heads to Green Bay to face a Packers squad that has quietly won 14 consecutive home games. The Packers are also a lucrative 8-2 ATS over their last 10 at Lambeau, and will will dominate from start to finish in Week 4.</p><p>

If the Braves pick up a sweep, they&#x2019;ll own the tiebreaker by virtue of having the better regular-season record and lead the Mets by two games. Got it? <strong>Here&#x2019;s what to watch for in the series:</strong> </p><p><strong>How to watch</strong></p><p>All three games will be televised nationally. Tonight&#x2019;s is on MLB Network (in addition to the team&#x2019;s local stations), tomorrow&#x2019;s is on Fox and Sunday&#x2019;s is on ESPN. </p><p><strong>The pitching matchups</strong></p><p>Today would usually be Chris Bassitt&#x2019;s turn in the rotation, but manager Buck Showalter is bringing out the big guns. <strong>Jacob deGrom is starting tonight against Max Fried</strong> in a matchup of both teams&#x2019; best pitchers. Because the Mets had an off day Monday, deGrom is not being forced to pitch on short rest. Showalter&#x2019;s decision also lines up deGrom to pitch on regular rest on the final day of the season if that ends up being a game that the Mets need to win. <strong>Max Scherzer gets the ball tomorrow night against Kyle Wright</strong>, and <strong>Bassitt will pitch Sunday opposite Charlie Morton</strong>. </p><p><strong>A big-time debut</strong></p><p>Speaking of big guns, <strong>the Mets are bringing in some serious offensive reinforcements</strong>. They&#x2019;re reportedly <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/francisco-alvarez-mets-callup">calling up Francisco &#xC1;lvarez</a>, the No. 1 prospect in all of baseball. &#xC1;lvarez, a 20-year-old catcher, is expected to get some at bats at DH over the final week of the season as he auditions for a spot on the postseason roster. </p><p>The Mets have gone with a platoon approach at DH in recent weeks, with left-handed-hitting <strong>Daniel Vogelbach</strong> getting the nod against righties and righty <strong>Mark Vientos</strong> facing lefties. Vientos, a rookie ranked by MLB.com as New York&#x2019;s No. 7 prospect, has struggled since being called up earlier this month. He has just four hits in 12 games. </p><p>With the lefty Fried set to start tonight&#x2019;s game, &#xC1;lvarez (a righty) figures to replace Vientos in the starting lineup. <strong>It&#x2019;s a big spot for a guy to be making his major league debut, but &#xC1;lvarez has the reputation to suggest he&#x2019;ll be just fine.</strong> He batted .260 with an .885 OPS in the minors this year, hitting 27 homers in 112 games. But he&#x2019;s done most of his damage against lefties, hitting .215 with a 1.019 OPS, and ended the season on a hot streak, batting .362 with a 1.079 OPS in 13 games at Triple A in September. </p><p><strong>The weather</strong></p><p>Earlier in the week when the weather forecast looked worse, <a href="https://twitter.com/nypost_mets/status/1575220681716862978?s=12&t=rcgzFntyfysrz7HFP_GGsQ">the Mets offered</a> to forgo the Thursday off day and get the series started then. But with the remnants of Hurricane Ian expected to remain farther east at this point, it looks like the series should be able to proceed uninterrupted. The forecast doesn&#x2019;t call for rain at the moment, but it is expected to be quite windy. </p><p><strong>What&#x2019;s next</strong></p><p>The good news for both teams is that even if they perform poorly this weekend, they still get to wrap up the season against a beatable opponent. The Mets finish with three games in Queens against the Nationals, while the Braves will travel to Miami for three against the Marlins. </p><p><strong>The playoff implications</strong></p><p>Both teams have already clinched a playoff spot, but MLB&#x2019;s new postseason format will really benefit whichever team wins the division. <strong>The division winner will be the No. 2 seed in the NL and earn a bye to the NLDS.</strong> Whoever wins the wild card will be the No. 4 seed and have home field advantage in a three-game wild-card series against the No. 5 seed, which will probably be the Padres. San Diego has a 2.5-game lead over the Phillies, who are a half game ahead of the Brewers in the race for the final playoff spot. </p><p><strong>So who has the advantage?</strong></p><p>I&#x2019;m tempted to say no one. I think the Mets are a marginally better team, but the Braves have the benefit of playing at home. Still, if I had to pick, <strong>I&#x2019;d say the Mets</strong>. There haven&#x2019;t been many teams in history who could trot out two pitchers as intimidating as deGrom and Scherzer in the first two games of the series. Starting pitching is incredibly important in a playoff series&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s basically what this is.</p><h2>The best of <em>Sports Illustrated</em></h2><figure>

    </figure><p>For more on the Braves, check out <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/30/austin-riley-daily-cover">Emma Baccellieri&#x2019;s Daily Cover on Austin Riley&#x2019;s emergence</a>: </p><blockquote><p>He broke into the majors with a hot streak in 2019. For a few weeks, his performance matched the best of the reports on him as a prospect: In his first 15 games, Riley was 21-for-59 with seven home runs. But then it started to fall apart. Opposing pitchers figured out that he was extremely vulnerable to anything in the top of the zone, and as he struggled to make that adjustment, other problems spread to the rest of his game. The Braves were using him primarily in the outfield&#x2014;though he came up as a third baseman, there had been early questions about his ability to stick at the position long term, and the team had been so eager to get his bat in the lineup that it tried him at left field that summer instead&#x2014;and he was struggling to find his footing there. It felt like nothing was going right. After posting a 1.143 OPS for the month of May, when he first came up, Riley put up a paltry .480 for July. He was briefly sidelined by a knee injury in August. The forced time away felt almost like a disguised blessing.</p></blockquote><p>And, for more on the Mets, Stephanie Apstein looked at <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/09/16/new-mets-daily-cover">how this team is trying to overcome decades of dysfunction</a> in her story from earlier this month. &#x2026; Terrifying injuries like the one Tua Tagovailoa suffered last night are <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/nfl-tua-tagovailoa-injury-complicated-unsettling">a reminder of how fraught it can be to love the NFL, Conor Orr writes</a>. &#x2026; Avi Creditor tried to project the <a href="https://www.si.com/soccer/2022/09/29/usmnt-world-cup-roster-projection-qatar-2022-final-squad">USMNT&#x2019;s World Cup roster after the final round of friendlies</a>. &#x2026; Here are our experts&#x2019; picks <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2022/09/30/ncaa-football-predictions-week-5-michigan-clemson-alabama">for a loaded week of college football games</a>.</p><p><strong>College football&#x2019;s Week 5 features a huge slate</strong> with some intriguing conference matchups. <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2022/09/29/hottest-tickets-week-5-games-demand-rankings-alabama-arkansas">The most sought-after ticket is No. 2 Alabama at No. 17 Arkansas</a>.

Boston was 11 games behind the Giants with a record of 35&#x2013;43 on July 18, but went 59-16-5 the rest of the way to surge into first place and clinch the pennant with a week still left to play. </p><p>Boston had finished the previous season in fifth place, 31.5 games behind the 101-win Giants, so it wasn&#x2019;t a surprise to see the team languishing at the bottom of the standings around what would be the All-Star break today. </p><p>The unlikely pennant race really energized Braves fans. The team&#x2019;s usual home field was the South End Grounds, which was much smaller than the new ballpark nearby, Fenway. So the Braves moved every September home game to the home of the Red Sox, who were fortunately on a long road trip. </p><p>The Braves capped off the season by sweeping the A&#x2019;s in the World Series for their second championship in franchise history.</p><h2>From the Vault: Sept. 30, 1968</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>It&#x2019;s a reasonably popular position today, but activists in Mexico City in 1968 had what was then a fairly radical idea: hosting the Olympics was not something to celebrate. Protests were just one of the issues facing the Games (construction delays, opposition to apartheid in South Africa, debates about the purity of amateurism), <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1968/09/30/games-in-trouble">John Underwood wrote in his cover story</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Then there was the question of Mexico&#x2019;s smoldering young activists. They don&#x2019;t like President Gustavo D&#xED;az Ordaz&#x2019; government, and they are trying to bring it down. As activists they are no different from the young at Berkeley or Columbia. That is to say, some of them are true idealists, and some are what Daniel J. Boorstin has termed the New Barbarians. They are unable to see any long-range good&#x2014;economic stimulation, national pride&#x2014;coming from a $150 million Olympic expenditure. There has already been rioting and gunplay in the streets of Mexico City. The rioters are clearly anxious to do their thing in front of plenty of witnesses (the Games will be carried for 42 hours in all on American television and for an average of 11 hours a day on Mexican television). Estimates of what they will do range from demonstrating (waving placards), to genuine acts of sabotage, to the provocation of street warfare.</p></blockquote><p>The talk of protests proved to be tragically prescient. Shortly after Underwood&#x2019;s story went to print, on Oct. 2, a large group of student protesters gathered in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco section of Mexico City. Police and military opened fire on the crowd, killing an unknown number of demonstrators. (The official report said <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45705009">26 people were killed</a>, while the protestors estimated there were 190 killed.) It came to be known as the Tlatelolco massacre and effectively stymied the student protest movement that had been active since August. President Ordaz was able to open the Games 10 days later without fear that an international audience would see protests against his government.</p><p>Mexico&#x2019;s ruling party, the PRI, repeatedly squashed attempts to investigate the massacre. It wasn&#x2019;t until Vicente Fox was elected in 2000&#x2014;the first president in nearly 70 years who was not a member of the PRI&#x2014;that a real investigation took place. It found that the Presidential Guard, a branch of the military, stationed snipers on the roofs of buildings in the plaza. The snipers were instructed to fire on the police and military controlling the crowd, <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97546687">documents show</a>, leading the troops to believe they were being fired upon by the students and return fire.</p><p><em>Check out more of SI&#x2019;</em><em>s archives and historic images at <a href="https://tempest.saymedia.com/vault.si.com">vault.si.com</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Sports Illustrated <em>may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</em></strong></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjk5MTMxMjA1MDAyNDQw/jacob-degrom-max-scherzer.jpg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNjg0NTA4NzIwNDA3NTgx/dcovaustinriley_v.jpg" height="814" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNjk5MDU2ODQ4MzgwOTU3/mexico-68-the-problem-olympics-boycotts-and-riots-september-30-1968-sports-illustrated-cover.jpg" height="427" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smith: NFLPA to ‘Pursue Every Legal Option’ in Tua Situation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The union’s investigation into the handling of the quarterback’s head and neck injuries this week remains ongoing.]]></description><link>https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/tua-tagovailoa-injury-nflpa-demaurice-smith-pursue-every-legal-option</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/tua-tagovailoa-injury-nflpa-demaurice-smith-pursue-every-legal-option</guid><category><![CDATA[Wire]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFL]]></category><category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zach Koons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 13:59:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjk4NjIzMzI1MTE5NTE3/demaurice-smith.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The union’s investigation into the handling of the quarterback’s head and neck injuries this week remains ongoing.</p><p>NFL players association executive director DeMaurice Smith said the union plans to &#x201C;pursue every legal option&#x201D; as it continues its investigation into <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/nfl-tua-tagovailoa-injury-complicated-unsettling">how the injury</a> to&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/team/miami-dolphins">Dolphins</a></span>&#xA0;quarterback&#xA0;<span><a href="https://www.si.com/college/college-football/player/tua-tagovailoa">Tua Tagovailoa</a></span>&#xA0;was handled over the last week.</p><p>Smith sent a statement to two members of the Amazon broadcast team, Andrew Whitworth and Richard Sherman, after&#xA0;Tagovailoa <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/30/tua-tagovailoa-stretchered-off-after-terrifying-hit-dolphins">left Thursday&#x2019;s game against the Dolphins with a head and neck injury</a>.
